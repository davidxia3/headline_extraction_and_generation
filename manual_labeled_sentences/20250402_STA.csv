"he observed that no bird soars in a calm, And that means that adversity can often be exactly what you need to give you a lift higher.",i
The joy of the bird was not getting to the top of the mountain.,i
their joy was climbing the mountain.,i
"So this climb that I'm in with the adversity that I faced with your guys- fraud in our government- the joy that I get is being able to stand here before you and be used by the most high God to shine a light on it, so the whole world can see what it really is, what's really going on in our world and in our government.",i

Back in my paralegal college days I was surrounded by teachers.,i

"research everything in life before you do anything and everything they instructed And oh, the smell of those law library books upstairs.",i
I was like a kid in a candy store.,i
I loved it And I discovered.,i
"I loved it From scriptures, history, local history, ancient history and family history research and even connecting lost families.",i
"I love research for free, because it's my passion and my gift from God.",i
It's my calm and my old age.,i
The same professor said: research before a job interview to be prepared.,i
"Well, I think, due to the recent kerfuffles in Washington, we need to add research, Research before you accept campaign funds.",i
We should research as a voter too.,i
"As a voter, I don't want to vote for a person who makes a deal in campaign promises with South African style musk rats.",i
A recent campaign article shared mega light campaign buying surrounding quarry Sole buying.,i
I call it Those mega donors.,i
I call campaign cartels.,i
accept them and they control you and your citizens.,i
"So I researched And we have a big time campaign cartel, courtroom docket junkie Number one.",i
"leading the numbers of courtroom docket junkies and mega campaign donors, Walnut Capital, Hundreds and hundreds of court cases and multiple LLCs.",i
"I checked Allegheny County, Westmoreland County and, this morning, Butler, And just the three counties.",i
since yesterday I was able to research.,i
"Walnut spends more time, and much too much time, in court.",i
The recovery of court junkie time is not being passed on to their grandmothers.,i
"It's passed on to our citizens, our renters, our buyers, our government contracts pass on to voters experiencing life.",i
I'm sorry.,i
any company spending so much time getting a new LLC and needs a special speedy file window in multiple county for You probably don't want them under the campaign sheets of favors.,i
When does it become too much?,i
"When does the young, new starting out small companies get a chance?",i
"When the control seeps in like a muskrat, controlling politicians and voters, does it become too much, but too late?",i
Have a good day.,i
Thank you very much.,i
Is there anyone else in chambers wishing to speak?,i

Thank you very much for being here.,i
"With that, we will turn to our standing committee agenda.",b
"Members, before you is a letter from the mayor asking to rescind the appointment of Jesse Durenna, And so I want to take that bill first.",b
So someone would please offer a motion to add bill 1346 back to our agenda.,i
So move Second.,i
"Second, All those in favor say aye, Aye, Aye.",i
"And now, if someone would offer a motion to withdraw, Say: Do you want me to read it?",i
"Oh, sorry, I'm moving too fast.",i
The clerk should read the bill.,i
I apologize.,i
"Yes, Bill 2024.",i
"1346 Resolution appointing Jesse Durenna as a member of the Commission on Infrastructure Asset Reporting and Investment, with a term to expire July 3rd 2027.",i
"All right, Now that the bill has been read, if someone would offer a motion to withdraw this appointment, So moved Second.",i
"All those in favor say aye, Aye, We will have been withdrawn.",i
"That will now take us to our finance and law committee, chaired by Councilman Schwarzberger.",b
"We have one deferred paper, Bill 1572.",b
"Bill 1572 resolution authorizing the City of Pittsburgh to accept the sum of 316,367 in full and final settlement of litigation filed in the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas involving the Finland Street Pedestrian Bridge.",i
Motion to approve Second brief discussion.,i
Brief discussion.,i
"Councilman Gross, Thank you.",i
I appreciate the administration meeting with me over this bill.,i
It was an executive session.,i
"I think I'm supportive today- but I just wanted to say on the record that my concerns around pedestrian safety on this section of Bigelow Boulevard- This is a settlement, so it's not really anything that we can do much about- right, We've settled with.",i
you know we've settled with the.,i
you know we've settled with the.,i
you know we've settled with the.,i
you know we've settled with the.,i
"I think the company that caused damage to the Finland Street Pedestrian Bridge that went over Bigelow so severely that it had to be taken down, But that leaves us without that pedestrian infrastructure there.",i
"And then, if you'll recall, this is a pedestrian bridge that's in between the pedestrian bridge at the Bigelow, at the Bloomfield Bridge on Bigelow, And then, as you're inbound, it's going to be the installation.",i
"then your next safe crossing is at Heron Avenue, which is actually not very safe and we're working on and it is real concern for the neighborhood, and there are bus stops on either side.",i
"So you may be living uphill from Bigelow and needing to cross, or you may be living below hill on Bigelow and needing to cross to get to Port Authority bus stops.",i
And so my ask is for Delmay to really do an audit of pedestrian safety and give suggestions of things that can be done.,i
So that is still to be worked out.,i
So right now you are able to cross at Heron and you're able to cross at the Bloomfield Bridge.,i
"So with that, I just wanted to get that on the record and it is work that remains in front of us.",i
"But I'm supportive of this bill today, which is just receiving funds from a legal settlement.",i
Any further discussion?,i
"If not, I'll simply note that your concerns about that stretch of Bigelow are well founded and very understood.",i
You said it before.,i
"but it's also worth noting that there used to be an underpass at the Heron Avenue intersection where you could go under the street, and the state decided to close that with no alert to the city.",i
They just decided to do it.,i
So your concerns are well founded.,i
"All those in favor say aye, Aye.",i
Any opposed Aye.,i
Affirmative recommendation.,i
That moves us to the new papers.,b
bill 1660.,b
"Bill 1660 resolution authorizing the issuance of two warrants in the total sum of 32,000 over one year.",i
"It is further understood and agreed that the payment schedule of the total settlement amount shall be as follows: 16,000 payable to Scott Allen Beatty, 16,000 payable to Samuel J Cordes Esquire in full and final settlement of litigation filed in the United States District Court for the Western District Court of Pennsylvania.",i
The bill is passed.,i
"Thank you, Any opposed Aye?",i
Any opposed Aye Next bill.,i
1660 resolution authorizing the mayor and the director of the Office of Management and Budget to enter into an agreement or agreements with USI Insurance Services for insurance brokerage services for all necessary policy types.,b
This shall be a no cost payment to any insurance brokerage services for all necessary policy types.,i
Motion agreement with a term of three years with two one-year options to extend.,i
motion to approve brief discussion.,i
"second, I'm not sure I understand what this is.",i
"frankly, if it's a no cost, how can we have a no cost service?",i
it's insurance brokerage.,i
"admittedly, I'm not.",i
"I apologize, I have not been briefed on this either.",i
do we have anyone from the audience?,i
"Patrick Cornell, if you please come forward?",i
"sure, Jennifer, sorry I didn't see you over there I always.",i
"good morning, Patrick Cornell, chief financial officer.",i
"Jennifer Olesinger, chief procurement officer.",i
so this is the end of an RFP for insurance brokerage services.,i
it is a no-cost contract.,i
that is because insurance policies are paid by the actual insurance providers as commissioned directly to the broker.,i
"so we will not pay this firm, but we will pay for the policies after the insurance broker is approved.",i
"so we will not pay this firm, but we will pay for the policies after the insurance broker has procured them on our behalf.",i
"curious standard for the industry and, and this is for all it says, all types of insurance policies.",i
"yes, when I just give us a really brief reminder of all of the types of insurance that we carry: we have a property coverage on our buildings.",i
we have boat insurance.,i
"we have insurance for cameras that we have on property that is not ours, so if a camera falls and breaks or whatever on somebody else's property, it would cover any damage.",i
we have a cybersecurity insurance.,i
"we have errors and emissions insurance for EMS and we have crime insurance for officers, elected officials.",i
"well, that was impressive and we proved our previous broker that that contract has expired.",i
so we did a new RFP and we are actually we're switching brokers to a different.,i
wonderful.,i
what is the timeline that we expect to see you come back to the table for your so we good question?,i
"we wouldn't need to come back for those individual policies as they would just be routed through this, this broker, but the new policies would go into effect may 1.",i
I do this all the time.,i
I ask questions and then I start pulling on threads.,i
"I'm sorry, so I don't like these wide open, blanket kinds of papers.",i
"so that to requesting to enter into a brokerage is one thing, but that you've, if you've, embedded approval of the resulting policies in the same bill, that makes me cranky.",i
so is that what's happening in front of us here?,i
"yes, the only thing I would add is that within OMB, City Council has approved the insurance premium payments in the current budget, and we're going to be able to get that back to you in the next couple of weeks.",i
so I'm just going to go ahead and ask you a question and then I'll get back to you in a minute.,i
so I'm going to go ahead and ask you a question and then I'll get back to you in a minute.,i
so I'm going to go ahead and ask you a question and then I'll get back to you in a minute.,i
so I'm going to go ahead and ask you a question and then I'll get back to you in a minute.,i
"so I'm going to in the regular budget process, not the same thing.",i
we also have contract approval authority and so it having a sequence of events of contracts seems a little expiry- quiero tener unINKAL- tales a little- but is transparent.,i
an it's our responsibility to protect and make sure there's transparency and things.,i
I'm not going to belabor this today because I wasn't prepared.,i
"maybe I'm misunderstanding what I'm hearing, so I'll So I'll leave it there, but I will think about it before final vote.",i
Appreciate it.,i
"That's all I have, Mr Chair, Thank you.",i

"sorry, you know.",i
"introduce yourself, please, anthony palermo, commander pittsburgh bureau police chief of staff.",i
"thank you, mr palermo.",i
just tell us what this is.,i
"sure, we received a, a pccd grant for aid in recruitment roughly a year ago.",i
"so, as our ongoing recruitment improvements are going on, one of the things we were looking for is to have a high quality recruitment video produced that we could use to social media, youtube, traditional media, just to kind of promote the opportunities, and so it's for marketing, for recruitment purposes.",i
is it done?,i
"no, no, so we have to prove the money and then you're going to do it and you have some.",i
you already have a production company.,i
"i mean, who do you honor for that?",i
"yeah, so it went out for rfp and look through all of them.",i
"this company was selected based on our needs and price, etc.",i
"so once it receives final approval, we'll meet and start kind of conceptualizing what it should look like and production schedules.",i
"and yeah, well, i'm really happy to see you're focusing on recruitment first of all, as we know, we need desperately.",i
so we still only have one recruitment officer.,i
i believe we have two now.,i
"two, okay, great, full-time, great great.",i
"i know we have a class coming up in june, correct?",i
and we don't.,i
we do not have one scheduled beyond that.,i
i believe a second one is scheduled for early november.,i
"okay, okay, that's it for me.",i
"so, thank you, thank you, thank you, yeah, thank you, councilman wolbert.",i
"i just was wondering: so is this just for the cost of producing the footage or does this also include like, disseminate?",i
"is this like, will they also be doing the social media?",i
"and you know, on the streaming channels, they would not do the marketing aspect of it.",i
"they would produce the video and then like for- excuse my ignorance on production terms, but like shorts, like shorter reels, and then we would explore.",i
do we need a marketing team or is it something we can do through our pios and social media?,i
people internally got it okay.,i
"and then, and just so, because i do recall that there was a grant, i can't remember how much, maybe a hundred, maybe a couple hundred thousand- that the recruitment- yeah, it was roughly three hundred and fifteen thousand, okay, somewhere right around there.",i
"okay, and i'm just curious: is this?",i
is this not part of?,i
is that not?,i
it is this what you paid for with with the grant money?,i
"great, thank you.",i
"thank you, councilman, gross.",i
"okay, i also am not very good at this stuff, so was?",i
is it like a national rfp was there?,i
i know we have some guidelines for trying to use local companies.,i
do you know anything about this company?,i
know I don't know what?,i
so it went out.,i
I believe- and excuse my ignorance- Fiona could probably help with this.,i
"Come on up, we're gonna bring her up, okay, I just feel like we've never done this before.",i
"Right, is this the first time for the?",i
"I'm sorry, you'll have to introduce yourself, Fiona Kalman, DBA for Public Safety at the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.",i
So this is like.,i
I don't remember seeing one of these bills before.,i
is this a new thing for us That the police department has done?,i
"Yeah, Yeah.",i
"so we did go out nationally on OpenGov, bid out and then made sure that we met all compliances, and that has taken the process a lot more months than it typically would, but check the boxes and do what we could.",i
"So again, I don't know why I'm asking these questions, but it's new and it's interesting, Is it that they're gonna be filming here And so they're making shorts, and not necessarily in this room, but in Pittsburgh, Yes, Yes, With our officers.",i
"Yes, Yes, As far as what it's gonna look like, I don't know why it's entertaining.",i
"Okay, everybody's laughing, it's not just me, okay.",i
"Okay, so it's a recruitment video and we're paying 30,000 from a grant, so we're not really anything out of pocket, and hopefully it'll help with recruitment because it'll get on social media or digital media or someplace, And the company that we're going with, Yeah, We've also produced police videos for other cities as well, so they're qualified And it works, Hoping it works.",i
"yeah, we plan on having it work, But it worked in the other cities.",i
"Yeah, Oh, okay, That's great, all right.",i
so I'm just thanks for answering my questions.,i
"I was just, you know, like I said, it's new, and so I was just curious how it was gonna work.",i
"Okay, Thank you.",i
"Yeah, that's all I have, Mr Chair.",i
"Thank you, Councilman.",i
"Sorry, There's nothing worse than a poorly timed, so I'll let you tickle.",i
So I'm interested in this.,i
"I think we all are interested because it's a new thing, But I'm really glad to see you know.",i
"I think the last I heard is that we're starting to see recruitment number or the number of applicants, I should say, starting to go up again, which Correct, I believe is great.",i
Can you talk to us about that at all?,i
"Sure, and I don't have the exact numbers, but kind of as a rough example, this, you know: past month, at the civil service examination that's tested monthly, we had roughly 170 people sign up to take it.",i
"i think 90 actually showed up, which is over double what we've seen in months prior.",i
"so too early to celebrate completely, but it seems our recruitment team, recruitment efforts are starting to bear fruit.",i
"that's that's something, something you should, you know, applaud yourself for and and the team that's working on this.",i
"that's quite, you know, really something to celebrate here.",i
"i, you know i think i've told the story at the table before, but i was in new york in the fall and i saw, you know, i was riding the subway and i saw advertisements like they have in their in their subway saying come join the police force.",i
but it was come join the police force in atlanta.,i
atlanta was advertising in new york subways.,i
so this is is something that i think everybody's trying to figure out: how to be creative and and how to.,i
"you know, it's a nationwide issue.",i
"how do, how do we get to that point where we're, you know, keeping up with the joneses in terms of recruiting.",i
"so i'm i'm glad to see, you know, a video.",i
"i'll should probably use officer andre as your, as your, your actor here.",i
"i i don't, i don't know, i'm just i, i don't know.",i
"yeah, we're going to need volunteers.",i
"andre wright is, is your, your ham?",i
"so, but yeah, i mean, i i'm excited to see it and excited to see what comes out of this and i hope this bears fruit.",i
"so cool idea, thank you, thank you.",i

"yeah, what?",i
"yeah, i'm sure.",i
"yeah, right, yeah, i'll be able to send and share and okay, good, yeah, probably a couple months down the road, but, yeah, right, yeah, yeah, i'm just saying like, so we could see it.",i

"that will result and at some point in the future, of 100 affordable homes for purchase in the eastern community, particularly in larmer, but it may extend into lincoln, levington and homewood at some point and also- this is part of negotiations that i participated in with the mayor- that will include a 10 affordable rental housing on site at 50 ami and then 5 at 80 to 120 ami and that'll.",i
there's just information in that as well.,i

i know there's going to be a lot of robust conversation and consideration about this.,i
i welcome that.,i
"i look forward to discussing this further, but i do want to applaud the larmer consensus group and the village collaborative for the hard work that they've done over the last three or four years, you know, to move this forward.",i
so i just want to give a little bit of context of what we're looking at.,i
"and again, this is part of a community benefits agreement negotiation that took place between the communities, as well as more recent negotiations between the mayor's office and myself around some on-site affordability.",i
that was not part of the original community benefits agreement.,i
all the affordability was going to be off-site and we were able to negotiate on-site affordability as well.,i

"okay, thank you.",i
any further discussion?,i
"if none, i'll simply congratulate you.",i
i do remember when reverend burgess sort of started this and for you to now be able to get it.,i
"it's not fully across the finish line, but there i know there's been a lot of work to reach both consensus within the neighborhood as it relates to both the off-site affordability and the four home, the home ownership opportunities, as well as the on-site affordability.",i
so i congratulate you on that and i hope that you will continue to do that.,i
and i hope that you will continue to do that and i hope that you will continue to do that.,i
"and i know you've been working on this since you took office, so there's been a lot of work to get to this point.",i
"so i just want to congratulate you, and i also want to congratulate sean carter, because i know you were working on this long before i was.",i
"so all those in favor say aye, aye, aye.",i
any opposed?,i

"so if you want to make a motion to hold both bills for cable cars public hearing, most of the whole.",i
for a cable cast public hearing.,i
"second, all those in favor say aye, aye, aye, any opposed.",i

"that takes us to intergovernmental and educational affairs committee, chaired by councilman mosley.",b
we have one deferred paper: bill 1589.,b

motion to approve any discussion.,i
one question just out of curiosity.,i
I'm just curious what agility agreement is.,i
why'd you ask the NFL?,i
"that's what they're doing in the NFL, don't they?",i
why'd you ask the NFL?,i
"that's what they're doing in the NFL, don't they?",i
"this is the director Lucious, hopefully.",i
"just one quick question, I'm just just out of curiosity.",i
"Kim Lucas, director for the city of Pittsburgh's Department of Mobility and Infrastructure.",i
the agility agreement is a no-cost agreement between us and PennDOT that just tracks things that we basically borrow from them.,i
"so in this instance, sometimes we need to use their crash vehicle to help protect the work that we're doing in the right-of-way, and there are sometimes a lot of times we're not able to pay for the work that we're doing in the right-of-way, and there are sometimes a lot of times we're not able to pay for the work, that they need some assistance of that type from us and so this is just a way to not have to pay each other but instead to track sort of what we're borrowing.",i
"thank you, thank you.",i
any further discussion if not all those in favor say aye.,i
any opposed affirmative recommendation?,i
"I actually want to go back and I apologize because I didn't see this until just now, but I got a note from Patrick Cornell regarding the ability to pay for the work that they're doing in the area and I'm going to go back and I apologize because I didn't see this until just now, but I got a note from Patrick Cornell regarding bill 1675 and councilwoman Strasburgers in the finance, which is regarding councilman's bill to sponsor, which councilman Wilson sponsored a land sale but the real estate team was unaware the parcel was struck from her November resolution and he couldn't immediately tell if it went through the full process again and he wants time to make sure that everything is done by the book with councilman Wilson.",i
"he's not against it, he just wants to make sure all I's are dotted and T's are crossed.",i
"so if someone wants to make sure that they're not in the way of the plan, then he's not going to be able to get a motion to reconsider the bill 1675 so moved.",i
"second, all those in favor say aye, aye.",i
and he's asking for a one-week cold to meet with councilman Wilson to make sure everything is appropriate.,i
"so can we make, make a go, make a motion over one week.",i
"second, all those in favor say aye.",i
any opposed bill be held for one week.,i

"excuse me, I just wanted to mention- I know there's been a lot of talk about the proposed 35% cuts at PRT and just let the public know that the public comment period has opened as of the 31st of March and is open until June 18th.",i
"so I strongly encourage anyone who's concerned, as a rider, as a stakeholder, to ensure that your voice is heard and that your voice is heard.",i

"so again, I just encourage the public to make their voices heard, as we, as I mentioned before, you know we are, you know, considering, you know, the comprehensive plan and many zoning and planning policies that require a robust public transit system.",i
we talk about transit oriented development and other policy issues.,i
so it's important that we have a robust system.,i
so I ask everyone to let your voice heard so that eventually we may all have to get on a bus to Harrisburg or something like that so we can get that same allotment of money that Philadelphia got last year to protect their public transportation system.,i
so I just wanted to mention that because this is the first week that the public comment has opened up.,i
"one more time we would like allovment of money to be spent because we talked to senators in about two weeks and the actual other, leb Proselyto's president, not, thank you, critical, important issue for us, anything else.",i
"if not, we need a motion to excuse the absent members, approve the minutes and adjourn the meeting.",b
so move.,i
an Hobby above the Minutes.,i
