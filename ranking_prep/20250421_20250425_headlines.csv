NO_HEADLINE,Pittsburgh Water pauses Four Mile Run and three other flood mitigation projects due to funding shortfalls.,Pittsburgh Water pauses four flood mitigation projects to prioritize funding for mandated system-wide repairs.,City Council discusses pause and funding challenges for Four Mile Run flood mitigation projects,0,NO_SUMMARY,"• Pittsburgh Water announced it is pausing four flood mitigation projects citywide due to funding shortfalls, including the Four Mile Run project that has been in development for six years

• The paused projects are Four Mile Run, Stewart Avenue, MLK Field, and South Side Park - with Four Mile Run being the most critical due to severe flooding that fills the neighborhood with sewage when heavy rains occur

• Pittsburgh Water has spent $8.7 million on the Four Mile Run project design, which is now 90% complete, but needs an additional $30 million for construction

• The project lost $10 million in funding from Alcasan when green infrastructure elements (stream daylighting) were removed due to permitting challenges with the state and CSX railroad

• Pittsburgh Water's $1.2 billion capital improvement plan over five years prioritizes mandated projects like the Water Reliability Plan (30% of funding) and lead service line replacement over stormwater projects

• Recent improvements to the M-29 outfall may have helped reduce flooding, but Pittsburgh Water is conducting hydraulic modeling to confirm the impact since no major storms have occurred since 2021

• Army Corps of Engineers representatives outlined potential federal funding programs that could provide 75% reimbursement for flood mitigation work if Pittsburgh Water applies

• Council Member Warwick expressed frustration that residents who fought against the Mon Oakland Connector road project now see their flood project canceled, calling it a crisis of faith in government

• Pittsburgh Water committed to completing analysis of recent improvements and exploring grant funding options before holding a community meeting in Four Mile Run","- Pittsburgh Water (PWSA) announced it is putting four major flood mitigation projects on hold to prioritize other critical repairs.
- The agency is shifting funds to a **$470 million**, court-ordered “Water Reliability Plan” to upgrade drinking water infrastructure. This is part of a larger, nearly **$1.2 billion** five-year capital plan that also prioritizes replacing lead service lines.
- The four projects being paused are:
    - Four Mile Run
    - Stewart Avenue
    - MLK Field
    - South Side Park
- The Four Mile Run project, which addresses severe sewage flooding, is now 90% designed but lacks the estimated **$30 million** needed for construction.
- PWSA has already spent **$8.7 million** on the Four Mile Run project's design and early phases.
- A key setback for the project was the loss of **$10 million** in funding from the Allegheny County Sanitary Authority (Alcosan). The funding was withdrawn after green infrastructure elements were removed from the plan due to technical issues, meaning the project no longer met Alcosan’s requirements.
- PWSA is now studying whether other recent sewer work in the Four Mile Run area has already helped reduce flooding.
- The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers stated that PWSA could apply for federal programs that may cover up to 75% of project costs.","- Pittsburgh Water has paused four major flood mitigation projects, including the Four Mile Run project, primarily due to funding challenges and increased construction costs.
- The Four Mile Run project is at 90% design but lost $10 million in funding after green infrastructure elements were removed, reducing its combined sewer overflow (CSO) reduction benefits below the funding threshold.
- Total project costs are estimated at $40 million, with about $8.7 million already spent on planning and design; construction alone is expected to cost around $30 million.
- Funding priorities have shifted toward mandated projects like the $470 million Water Reliability Plan, which addresses critical drinking water infrastructure and is court-ordered.
- Technical and permitting issues, including disagreements over stream lining and railroad right-of-way constraints, also complicated the Four Mile Run project.
- Pittsburgh Water continues to maintain existing infrastructure and respond to flooding complaints despite the project pause.
- The Army Corps of Engineers highlighted potential federal funding programs that could support future stormwater projects if Pittsburgh Water pursues partnerships.
- Councilmembers expressed concern over the impact on residents, especially in Four Mile Run, where flooding and sewage backups remain serious problems.
- Pittsburgh Water plans to complete design work and conduct hydraulic evaluations to assess recent improvements, such as the M-29 outfall reconstruction.
- Community engagement and transparent communication are planned before any future public meetings on the project’s status and next steps."

  - All other zoning rules remain unchanged.
- While Council generally supported the text, some members raised concerns about:
  - Timing the vote right after this week’s severe storm
  - Whether zoning changes should be made individually or all at once
  - If minimum lot sizes were the most critical amendment among many under consideration
- The bill received an affirmative recommendation, passing 5–1 with two abstentions. Councilperson Gross voted against with Councilpersons Lavelle and Warwick abstaining. Councilperson Mosley was absent.

  - Very High Density (VH): None","• Pittsburgh City Council held a public hearing on Bill 1579, which would reduce minimum lot size requirements across all residential zoning districts in the city

• **Current vs. proposed minimum lot sizes:**
  - Very low density: 8,000 to 6,000 square feet
  - Low density: 5,000 to 3,000 square feet  
  - Moderate density: 3,200 to 2,400 square feet
  - High density: 1,800 to 1,200 square feet
  - Very high density: 1,200 square feet to no minimum

• **The bill would eliminate minimum lot size per unit requirements** that currently restrict how many housing units can be built on a property

• City planning staff showed that **18% to over 50% of existing lots** in various residential districts don't meet current minimum size requirements, making many homes technically non-conforming

• **Supporters argued** the changes would make housing more affordable, allow rebuilding of homes that match neighborhood character, and reduce barriers for developers at the zoning board

• **Critics raised concerns** about increased density in already crowded areas, potential for gentrification, and preference for addressing short-term rentals instead

• The bill was originally part of a larger zoning package that included inclusionary zoning and parking reforms, but Council Member Wilson separated it for individual consideration

• **Many speakers urged Council to consider the full zoning package together** rather than piecemeal, arguing the reforms work better as a comprehensive approach

• The bill has support from Council Members Wilson (sponsor), Warwick, and Charland (co-sponsors)","- The City Council held a public hearing for Bill 1579, which proposes reducing the minimum lot size required to build a home and removing the minimum lot size required per housing unit.

- The bill, sponsored by Councilmembers Wilson, Warwick, and Charland, is based on a recommendation from the 2022 Housing Needs Assessment to help address the city's housing shortage and affordability challenges.

- City Planning staff explained that a large number of existing city lots are smaller than current rules allow, making it difficult to build new homes or even rebuild existing ones. The proposed changes include:
    - **Very-Low Density:** 8,000 sq. ft. reduced to 6,000 sq. ft.
    - **Low-Density:** 5,000 sq. ft. reduced to 3,000 sq. ft.
    - **Moderate-Density:** 3,200 sq. ft. reduced to 2,400 sq. ft.
    - **High-Density:** 1,800 sq. ft. reduced to 1,200 sq. ft.
    - **Very-High Density:** 1,200 sq. ft. minimum requirement removed entirely.

- Many members of the public spoke in favor of the bill, stating that current rules make much of the city's historic housing illegal to rebuild. They argued the changes would allow for more housing to be built on vacant lots, increase supply, and ""re-legalize"" homes that fit neighborhood character.

- A second group supported the idea but opposed passing it separately from a larger package of zoning reforms. They argued that this ""piecemeal"" approach would pass developer-friendly changes while leaving behind more critical affordability measures like inclusionary zoning.

- A third group of speakers opposed the bill entirely, arguing it would lead to overcrowding, harm neighborhood quality of life, and benefit ""predatory landlords"" without creating truly affordable housing.","- The City Council held a public hearing on Bill 1579, which aims to reduce minimum lot size requirements across Pittsburgh’s residential zoning districts to encourage more housing development and affordability.  
- The bill lowers minimum lot sizes as follows:  
  - Very Low-Density: from 8,000 to 6,000 sq. ft.  
  - Low-Density: from 5,000 to 3,000 sq. ft.  
  - Moderate Density: from 3,200 to 2,400 sq. ft.  
  - High Density: from 1,800 to 1,200 sq. ft.  
  - Very High Density: removes minimum lot size entirely.  
- It also eliminates minimum lot size per unit requirements, which currently restrict multi-unit housing development, especially duplexes and triplexes.  
- The reform addresses a major barrier where many existing lots (up to over 50% in some districts) do not meet current minimum lot sizes, making many homes technically illegal and new development difficult without variances.  
- Supporters emphasized that the bill would legalize many existing homes, allow more modest and affordable housing types, increase housing supply, and promote walkability and transit use.  
- The bill is based on recommendations from the 2022 Housing Needs Assessment and has been vetted through extensive public engagement and planning commission approval without conditions.  
- Several speakers urged passing this bill quickly to address Pittsburgh’s housing crisis, while also calling for the full comprehensive zoning package—including inclusionary zoning and parking reforms—to be adopted together for maximum impact.  
- Some opponents expressed concerns about potential neighborhood crowding, gentrification, and the piecemeal approach of separating this bill from the full zoning reform package.  
- Councilmembers sponsoring the bill highlighted the need to move forward with this “clean fix” now to unlock vacant lots, reduce red tape, and align zoning with the city’s historic built environment.  
- The hearing concluded with broad council support to advance the bill while acknowledging ongoing debates about the broader housing reform package."

• The agreement allows the city's waste collection system to handle the increased volume more effectively than private contractors while ensuring the university pays the full cost.","- The University of Pittsburgh will pay for the city to conduct up to 15 extra trash collections in the Oakland neighborhood.
- These supplemental pickups will happen as needed, with a focus on times when trash piles up, like during student move-in and move-out periods.
- The university will pay the city for its ""actual costs incurred"" for the extra work, covering labor, equipment, and disposal fees.
- This arrangement was created because past efforts by the university to hire a private company for the same job were considered confusing and not very effective.
- City officials noted that an earlier attempt to place large dumpsters on the street during move-out was unsuccessful because they were misused by people from outside the neighborhood.","- The City Council approved an amended resolution allowing the Mayor and Public Works Director to enter into an agreement with the University of Pittsburgh for supplemental waste collection in the Oakland neighborhood at no cost to the city.  
- The University will fund up to 15 additional waste pickups annually, mainly during high-trash periods like student move-in and move-out.  
- The amendment changed the payment from a fixed $3,000 per event to covering actual costs incurred, allowing flexibility due to fluctuating recycling and landfill fees.  
- The University had previously tried managing waste pickups with a private vendor, but it was less effective and caused confusion.  
- Public Works will now handle the supplemental pickups, with costs reimbursed by the University to cover labor, equipment, and disposal fees.  
- Councilmembers expressed appreciation for the partnership and emphasized the importance of maintaining cleanliness in Oakland, while also noting ongoing waste challenges in other neighborhoods.  
- The agreement requires approval by the City Solicitor before finalization."
