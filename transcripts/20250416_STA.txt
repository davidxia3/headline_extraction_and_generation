Good morning, My name is Yvonne F Brown. I live at 715 Mercer Street, up at the top of the hill That's Crawford and Bedford- Red alert. My councilman is not here, but there are two of you sitting here looking at me. I want you to please tell my councilman that you come down to Bedford. You got one One side of the hill. you go down One. you're supposed to come up. Well, about 830 last night I happened to be looking down and I seen two cars going down Bedford at the same time. One that's not supposed to go down there. There is a—the only reason why I'm bringing that up, because if you don't know about that area, you can get mixed up And I see where, if they just put even an arrow to point one down, you got to go this way. There was two of them. How about that? Actually, One of them was going down and one's supposed to be coming up. They were going down at the same time. That person on that left-hand side did not know it And we do need a sign. I wish you would—if one of you would go up there and actually look If you're coming down, you would not know it. I know it because I live there. But please- I've seen a couple cars go down there before. Also, I'm still upset about Corey. Now this is Corey's. He's running for mayor. I couldn't find the one of Ed Ganey, but it was dark like this. See this blackness. This is how they made dark—made- the mirror. I don't care for the mirror myself, but right, don't wrong nobody. They're trying to put fear into us that he's dark, sinister, something's wrong with him, Whereas with Corey they got him, Oh, his natural color. But they made Ganey. See, you just play the race card and you say: we do. I didn't think about that until I seen it. I said how the mayor gets so black? They made him that way. He's not that color And I want you to understand. we as black people see it. You just might pretend like: oh, we don't—we didn't do it. But we see what's happening. That man is not that dark. How come he got all black just before it's time for him to run for election? The same way with Petit Up in his—up in our area. he got a big sign for Petit. He got a big sign for Petit. He got a big sign for Petit. He got a big sign for Petit. He got a big sign for Petit. He got a big sign for Petit. For Petit, he's running. Well, let me tell you who else is running This man: Jeff Woolwolf, W-O-O-D-A-R-D. Now someone- one of the residents in my building- told me he was in the building the same day that Lavelle and his man was in the building. This man is running for Petit's job. Now I have a problem with Petit Because of him. we have that actor, the bad actor that keeps coming. That bad actor, That bad actor, That bad actor, That bad actor, That bad actor, That bad actor. And he was coming in the building because the police said, not me, they're dropping the ball. He said Arbor and Petit, And he is dropping the ball. And the reason why I'm saying that I've got one more. My time is up, But anyway, please help us, Please. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. Next speaker, please. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. Good morning. Special Agent Sunshine. how's everybody? Everybody's not here. God, you're amazing. I know what you're doing in the background. Lord, please protect me from the voodoo, hexes, curses that may be sent towards me in this chamber. I return them to send a 100 million billion trillion Google Plex And whoever's sending them. throw them into a lake of fire. In Jesus' name, I pray Amen. I'm going to start with the wisdom for today. It comes from Proverbs 21: 13. It says those who shut their ears to the cries of the poor will be ignored in their own time of need. A lot of people being ignored. It's not good. God is very angry about it. God blesses us so that we might bless others. My cup runneth over because I'm here to be a blessing, Not to get blessings. You can't get one without being one. It doesn't take an hour to preach that A woman of character loves herself above all others. We love God and ourselves. But in this world that we live in today, we have misogynistic men who have a problem with women: Strong women, Independent women, Educated women, Saved, Celibate women. They have a problem with us. You know why? Because God created us for them. God created women for men. It'll never be the other way around, And misogynistic men have a real big problem with that. Well, if I'm the problem, I'm going to be the brightest, shiniest problem a misogynistic man will ever have, And the one I speak of today. his name is James Engle. He's the man who runs the Northside Overflow Shelter, who is a misogynistic man. He had a problem with me leaving and his employees helping me with my luggage. He wouldn't let them do it. It was very, very ugly, And Maya Angelou once said: you never forget what people say, but you will always remember how they make you feel. And the way he made me feel Was stronger. You know why? Because I moved everything that I had to move myself. Because I praise God for my health and my strength In Jesus' name. I pray that he has the health and the strength that he's going to need for the karma that's coming for him, For how he treats people, Especially women. Proverbs 31. 10 says an excellent wife who can find she is far more precious than jewels. I'm not married yet. I'm kind of running from men, But God is stopping me at my trace. Amen In Jesus' name. Amen. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please Are there any further speakers Seeing none. we will now move on to our standing committee's agenda. Our first committee is the Finance and Law Committee And we have one deferred paper: Bill 1634. Bill 1634 resolution repealing an item in resolution number 512 of 2022. Effective date: September 23, 2022. in order to rescind the sale. Motion to approve discussion. Move a second, Oh, second Second With discussion, Councilman Coghill. Okay, thank you, Madam Chair. I would like to. I guess let's just start with bringing To the table Mr Geiger and the others here that can answer any questions as far as this, Why I put this bill in. Director Gula, thank you, Yes, Good morning. I'm Jen Gula, the city treasurer and director of finance, David Geiger, legislative and policy director. Okay, thank you, Thank you both for being here. Sure, We spoke about this last week- I think was the last week- But now I've been struggling with this right. Okay, Just because it was brought to my attention. I never. I don't know how processes work in certain departments in the city of Pittsburgh, But I just want to for other council members to know the kind of how it came to my attention, And then you could fill in the gaps and questions that we might have for you. Okay, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Okay, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. Okay, So we have a process where, if somebody wants to purchase a city-owned property, they put hand money down, And is there a certain percentage that's always on that, Or is it always on the percentage of that sale of the building? Is that right? It's a percentage of the sale of the building or the land, or 250, whichever is greater, Got it, Okay? So a constituent- Yeah, So a constituent, Yeah- came to me- this property lies in brookline, my district, of course- and told me the scenario that they had went through. so what happened was they put the hand money down in expectation to get the property. you know, obtain the property, i think in our forms it says it could take anywhere from 18 to 12 to 18 months or something of that nature. so, so she put the money down, and a substantial amount, i would say, put the money down and i guess we put that money towards the administrative costs and things of that nature. is that, is that what we do with that hand money? or do we just hold that? it goes in escrow? because an escrow, okay, good, good. so it went beyond the 18 months. it was, i think, a little bit over two years, finally that this person decided- you know what the place looks like- it's deteriorated beyond what is really repairable, okay. so he or she was asking for money back, right, and we talked about this. we were worried as a city that it might set precedence, because we don't typically do that- it's in the agreement- whereas you know you put the hand money down, you're kind of tied into the property at that point. there's no refunds, basically, well, not entirely okay. so that's on the bills ofrez against you small area houses. but yeah, are there any real some other documents like hyphens, mentioned in, i think, maybe the statue, whatever? is there stuff around the council? so the reason why this last thoughts is continuing to take- i think that's what the discussion is going on for a wholeOUR. Okay, I just want to state that as the city, I think we have issues with our process more than anything. But you're correct and you know we don't want to set a bad precedence. It's not, it's kind of in the agreement, but also in the agreement is eight, twelve to eighteen months and you know Things of that nature. I think what's really wrong here- and the reason why I want to- I really wanted to just bring this to Light so we can correct this moving forward- is the 24 plus months right Now. I rode by, I go by this house, houses right at the bottom of the hill for me. I went by there today and I'm telling you there was holes in the roof of this big around right. That's like bad, bad news all the way down, right. I mean it's like This person is probably not the right person for this property. I will tell you not at this point. The right person is somebody like me: a general contractor come in and has to like kind of strip this Property down to nothing, basically, and rebuild it. That's kind of where I feel that's just an outside observation from the ground. I wasn't inside this place, I didn't inspect it or anything of that nature, right? So So this person wants to move that down payment at four thousand dollars That they had put down for the to the shore, that cost to shore this property up to another property, and we don't do that either. We have not done that. We've not. there's not a president's of that, That's not. we've done it one time. Okay, and we did it one time because Solely on the part of the city, the and it may have even come to A point where their original application had been lost, and there was some. It was one of the sorbs, It was one exception to the rule. I understand We don't want to make this a norm. I get it. I think you're doing the right thing by sticking to. you know, yeah, we don't. you know We don't want to go off course, share- We really don't. and then who knows? you know how many sales are pending out there. I have no idea. I'm honest with you. I have to say that the reason that it's like this is because at a certain point, the city starts to expend money in order to complete the sale. so we Pay, like quiet title costs which we hope to recuperate at the close of the sale. So, and this money comes out of the 3 TB trust fund, a trust fund that we've worked extremely hard To keep from going into the negative and have built it back. So if we consistently allowed people to actually do that and refund all of that money after we've expended it, Then that becomes a problem. right, I agree, and You know, to be honest with you, I'm not necessarily asking you to refund this person's money. I think that it is the right thing to do, and you know. But I don't think we're in a position. We'd have to get our solicitor up here and, I think, talk further about this. Unfortunately we don't have the time right. the sale of this property is coming up, I think within two weeks, as to that person needs to act on it or we just need to rescind the sale and they lose The money, right. so so that's where we're at with this. I would love to Refund this person, but I understand exactly what you're saying. Okay, but again I feel like we're bad Realtors here. I guess you right. I mean, we take hand money down and again this substantial amount, four thousand dollars, I think it's okay for me to say that, You know, on a piece of property that at the time was probably worth every bit of what that person's paying for it, two years goes by And again I'm almost positive. I can't say certainty, but the person would not have, You know, went ahead with that hand money had they seen the hole in the roof this big around in the front You can see from the street, you know, and that tells me basically big, big, big problems, right. So whether it was bad decision from their part, maybe, you know, maybe that place wasn't inspect out, in inspected two years ago. Did it just all fall apart in two years? I can't say that. you know, I could tell you that hole probably wasn't there because that would have been like so. so my, what I'm really trying to achieve is Moving forward. I feel like we need to move these properties. We don't have to move them if we stabilize them though, right. I mean I mean just bring in public works crews. right, We could do that in-house. I would hope just to out of the 3 TV trust fund. It needs to be paid from there. So unless that trust, we can't do in-kind work from the city. No, we can't say W charges us if we send. you know, if we send public works crew out to board up a building because The windows were broken out or the door has been compromised, I mean we charge us for it And it goes. it gets charged to the trust fund. so I mean, Ideally that's the place that we would like to be in. director Hornstein, We're not you a bill, basically, For we pay holding it up and that goes. where's that money? I'll go to it, It would go to them. or even if they charge us for demolition, I mean we hope to recoup costs on demolitions when we. but it gets, you know, bill to us. We may not pay it instantly, Instantly at that moment, but eventually, you know it's supposed to come from that trust fund and reimburse this. It's not necessarily in kind and something like repairing roofs- It gets paid out of the 3 TV trust fund, like we would have to Secure a contractor and pay for it. So even if you use in-house, were built for it, something like that- It's likely to give you a discount at least. So, anyway, what my point is this: moving forward, We need, if we accept hand money on a piece of property and if we're not sure, we can turn it around and say eight months, First of all, I'll need to be in writing. this all needs. you know that we have 12 to 18 months. It could take. this took 24 months. We need more clarity, right, We need to do in a certain time period or we need to stabilize. I think the best thing is stable. part of that timeline, though, is also attributed to how fast the actual purchaser acts. so this specific purchaser we requested- I think we sent them a letter in October of 22- Said that the legislation had passed and you're now required to give us a title report, and we didn't get it. It's supposed to be in within 60 days. We didn't get it until like four months after that, So we didn't get it till sometime in January. Yeah, I'm not Like China And we say 12 to 18 months, but there could be. there's things that we don't have control over and part of that is quiet title with the courts and Even though we may file a petition, it could take a long time for it to move through the court process in Order to get final orders and complete it. Okay, and let me just stop right there for a second. So if They, you know you do all the title clearance whatever- you pay an attorney, I guess, to do this groundwork. So if, like this person's asking to switch that credit that they put down to another property- What amount of work is done On that first property that we don't have to do again- that we could credit this person for meaning title clearance. right, I mean right, there's certain things that are done out of that hand money That will be there for the next buyer that we don't have to do again. That's what I'm asking. right, we would put it up for what they call sealed bid and we would put a bid amount and send a letter to. I Guess whoever else was interested in it could apply for it and we'd have to Put up for bid where they would enter in a bid price through them. I mean, we have to go through the whole same process for, so say, for instance, If we gave this person back there, refunded their hand money, Would you have to go through the same process every part of the expense that the titles already quieted, Expended the money for it. So it's title right, but it's quieted title in the name of the purchaser, So we would probably have to go back to court and adjust it to the city. Okay, I'm probably getting off too fast. Okay, I get it. You know, I know there's this complicated, believe me, and that's why I struggled with such a thing. I'm like I've never been in this situation. David, you can say I'll let you speak as soon as I'm done with my last point here. Okay, the ultimate goal here, I feel, is like: right, this is a person, a young professional, wanting to go through the city of Pittsburgh, purchase a Affordable home. what they thought or think is an affordable home. so Again, when I say we're bad Realtors, this person's leaving losing their hand money. I'm not, I'm not casting blame on us or this person, necessarily, But this is the result and sour to our process. I'm sure I haven't spoken to that person on those terms and We got a property that's still blighted and sitting there. and you know, I'm thinking, if we did just stabilize this thing, I'm sure that person would have gone through with this sale and we'd have this thing back on the tax roll And so. so now I still got a blighted piece of property there. This person doesn't have a home and probably can't. You know, I don't know what 4,000 means to this person, Right, but to me it's a lot of money, to me still, right, and I'm 60, so So, so that's my goal is really to get the process moving. I would like to see a stabilization now. I understand, director complications. if public works is billing us, Maybe we could straighten that out here at the table. I don't know, You know, I have no idea, to be honest with you, But but if we can use public works people just to do the basic repairs, So this property doesn't deteriorate to a point where it's- and you, you couldn't even move in this property for a year, There's that type of work to do: chimneys, roofs, Windows, siding, doors, you name it right, That's just the exterior. So so I just don't want anybody else to be in a bad deal and- and I'm not saying we set this person up. This property is probably worth what we're asking for to somebody like me who can come in with trucks and labor and not Expend that type of money on it. So so I like the asking price. I just really want to make good for this person so they can use that money and- and if we can do it in any tricky way- Transfer, I don't know, you know, just find a way where they can still put use that some credit. there Doesn't have to be all of it. you know, if we could Figure out what we expended on the first time that we don't have to this time, Maybe there's a difference there, I don't know. So so that's my goal. Okay, I know you're uncomfortable with it, I'm uncomfortable with it. I I wish you, you know, wasn't in my lap to be honest with you. So so go ahead. I'm sorry. Yeah, please, Councilman, I just wanted to, you know, make sure that we're addressing your, your global concern, and not just the the minutia of this sale. right, and you know, as we've discussed, you know, we want to thank City Council for their work and investments on tools like the land bank. I think the situation we're talking about here on a. you know the specific case is Really well suited for a land bank transaction in the future. the process started well before we got the land bank up and running and moving and processing properties. But the the flaws in the city sales process from a structural standpoint Right, are the reason why we've worked so hard to get the land bank functional after a decade of it not being functional. And so I I just wanted to point out that you are correct. This probably isn't a, you know, great process for the scale of the project, for the individual in their capacity. and To your points about improving the process, I think we've already done a lot to improve the process and make the public options available through the land bank And you know that's a credit to City Council as well. I Agree and you're absolutely right. This really belongs in the land bank. I feel right. I mean, this is what we kind of created the land bank for. this still, like you said, started before, So wasn't could even be part of that process. I guess could this sale of this property go to the land bank now, if I Mean- I Don't necessarily know the legality of it- We recent, if we it wouldn't solve, to answer your question, Most simply wouldn't solve the question at hand, which is that the legislation on the table right now does seek to refund the hand money, Which we'd like to see amended. I think we would still like to see that part of the bill struck. and then whether or not it makes sense To move forward with a land bank transaction is a question beyond you know, the, the director and myself. it would have to involve You know land bank staff and other individuals talking to the interested party here and trying to figure that out, But I do think it's a potential solution for sure. Right, Is there a Director? is there a record of others asking for their money back, or is that something that doesn't commonly happen, or is it? there are some occasions where people do ask some situation like The buildings, like not what I mean. you know various situations And we've denied every single time: Okay, Well, that's, that's Even in the man. someone did take us to the magistrate over it and they held our contract, got it. Yeah, I understood, understood, And again, I'm not really trying to. I don't want to city to do something It's not comfortable with in a legal way, honestly. so I'm gonna vote for it Anyway today, just out of principle. but You know, I really Hope we could just dive right in and change how. to be clear, We're not against the principle, We're just Against, I guess, a precedent that it could set in the future. I believe that could bankrupt that trust fund and you should be, yeah, and you should be honestly so. you know again, I'm not casting fault or blame, I'm just saying when we take hand money on a piece of property, It should be at least in as good as shape as when we took that hand money. But let's be clear. this first point is: I'm gonna leave these times easy. I think that is. I would agree fully. So you give me your take on this Question. first, Yes, you can probably see. I thinkidades in a delay. I haven't actually read it. I'm gonna period. Second question: definitely Ask: What is this difficult right here? It's just this: this Consumption of money is absolutely Right. I'd go this way. So two families have iso. The simplest solution here is shortening the amount of time that the sales process takes that way. I agree with you in principle. Our goal should be, when somebody enters an agreement of sale for a property, that we should be moving as quickly to get that out of the public hands and into their hands so that what they've agreed to buy is in a substantially similar state and that they're able to get moving as quickly as possible. I think that benefits the individual, it benefits the neighborhood and the residents surrounding that property and, ultimately, is a fiscally responsible decision for the city, which is again why I will keep emphasizing the use of the land bank as a tool. I think some of those other solutions you're bringing up may have been worth exploring. if something like the land bank— I got you- If we didn't have the land bank, the land bank wasn't up and running. You're not saying more Honestly, you're right on. You really are. This is an unfortunate situation. I'm really just trying to—the person. I'm sure this money means a lot to them, and probably the difference of them securing a home or not. I want people to be encouraged to use the city process to buy these homes. I guess it's hard for me to speak up because I have no clue as to what the rest of the inventory looks like. Is it buyable? Is it movable? How much money do you have to put into a certain property, But this certain property, if this council doesn't approve this money back. I don't think this candidate or this person has the resources. It's going to be a quarter million dollars to bring this place up to speed. I will tell you That's what I'm thinking about. That's conservative. I mean everything right From the top to the bottom. Maybe the frame- Hopefully parts of the frame- are good. So, again, it was really the wrong customer for the wrong house and that's probably not our fault, honestly. That's all for now, Thank you. Thank you for your time. I think it's time for me. I guess I'll open up to other council members, Appreciate you working with me on this and hopefully the land bank could settle all this stuff for us in the future. So thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Sorry it takes so long. No, that's okay. We have a couple of other members who have indicated they'd like to speak: Council Member Warwick and then I know Councilwoman Gross online would like to speak. Hey, thank you. Just so I'm clear on Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay. So we had someone who wanted to buy. This was a city-owned property- Someone who wanted to buy it. How much was the for sale price? 40,000, Okay. So they wanted to, So 40,000, and they put down 4,000, Like a 4,000 sort of hold. What was this? 4,000, Okay, And they put down 4,000, Yeah, So they put down 4,000. And they put down 2,000, Yeah, 2,000, So, 2,000, Okay, So every time they'd like to, So we have a chance to go inside and check it out and all of that Yep At the beginning. And was there some kind of like report, Like you know, state of the property report or something like that? We don't do that, but we will set up a. Okay, If they wanted to go in and view the property, they could bring whoever they'd like to go and view it with them and give opinions on how much things would cost and what repairs would be needed. They could bring whoever they wanted to. Okay, So they could anybody. and then- that's part of the process- they could schedule a viewing with the staff and they'll take them out- Okay, to the property, open it up for them and they can go in and see- Okay, whatever they needed to see. and take any contractors- Okay, I wanted to with them. and do we have someone there? like, if they want to do that, Do we have someone there? they set up an appointment and my staff go out with them. Mm-hmm, They coordinate ahead of time. They set a date just like you would. for you know, like a, I'm just a real estate agent, okay, open, not necessarily an open house where it's open and people come in and out, but they would schedule a viewing and After that they, if they decide to move forward, what they signed, some contract that says there's a proposal to purchase, Okay, that they sign it's a contract, and they put down their hand money, Okay, and then we send legislation to City Council- I think we actually have legislation on the books today with a List of properties that those are people that have applied, they've been approved as buyers. They put down their hand money and now we're presenting them to you to okay the sale those properties to these individuals. okay, so, and in that contract does it say anything about, like, You're compelled to to go through with this? it, Regardless of what happens to the property between now and then? it does then okay, Okay, So. So we don't actually know, Sort of like, the state of the property. we don't have a record of the state of the property at the time that this initial exchange happened, Like whether there was a hole in the roof or whether now, so we, okay, Maybe that would be something to Even just like a, I mean if we're there anyway normally. so when we price a property, we look at comparable properties in the same area in order to determine a price. normally, if the staff is aware of compromises like that, some especially something that's visible, like a hole in the roof that you could see from the street, those things would have been noted and taken into consideration at the time of the pricing. okay, okay. so i mean, do we acknowledge that the whole came over the course of the? i would assume it would, would have come after, or else we probably would have noted that there was a hole in the room, there was a hole in the roof, okay and okay. so so the contract was signed, the they paid their four thousand dollars. you know, they put down their four thousand dollars and then you said there was, we sent them something and then it took four months for them to send it back. so after we send the legislation to council and council approves the sale, usually send a letter okay, stating that council has approved your sale, the sale is ready to move forward. you need to secure a title report and i think we give them 60 days, okay, in order to they're they're responsible for getting one and submitting to us, okay, a title report. that title report is then used to start the quiet title process. got it okay? so the 60 days, so two months, do we send like a reminder, like maybe they didn't get the letter or something like that? i'm not sure if they do they. i think manda might reach out if she notices that there's no response and it goes on for a while. okay but, and she may do that by phone or email, okay, okay, but in any case it was, it was four months to get get the quiet title process moving. yep, and then, and- and i know that this can vary, but in your experience, what is assuming you had, like you know, an attorney who was ready, you know, just had nothing better to do but quiet this title right, what would be, generally speaking, the, the fastest turnaround generally on on quieting a title? like eight months to a year, that's moving really quick i think and that depends on. so, as part of the title report there's a list of basically a creditor, like anyone that would have any financial interest in the, in the property, that, or any attachments, and they have to send notice to all of those people in that list and they have to give them a certain amount of time to respond in order to object to the quiet title of the property. so, depending on whether or not they hear back from the those individuals, they may have to mail things multiple times if they get no response from them. okay, so that. so that's like a year, basically, no matter whether you're the land bank, whether you're the city, whether you're, it takes, it takes months to actually do that, but it's at least 30 to 60 day notice, and if they don't receive something back, it may start that time clock all over again. okay, so, even like best case scenario, we're at 14 months, right, because of the initial delay and then, and then quieting the title. the quiet title is the longest part of the process. the quiet titles hands down. so, oh, and here's a question, how much do? well, do we know how much we paid to? did we quiet the? we quieted the title on this property, okay, and do we know how much we paid to do that? it's at least. i think it might actually depend, but i'm not entirely sure, but we did expend money to do it. So, a couple hundred dollars at least. Oh, just a couple hundred dollars. It could be upwards of that I don't know. Are you sure You know offhand? I'm sorry, That's okay. I don't think we have a known cost. in addition to attorney's fees, You'd have to calculate in staff time and capacity spent. These are all sort of the expenses to the public that the hand money is meant to account for. But it probably wasn't 4,000. I have no idea. I don't know how much staff time or attorney time was spent on this property, So it's hard to say It really is. The filing fees could be a couple hundred to 1,000, but there could be more involved in that. Okay, Okay, And then again. so I guess I'm a little confused too about DPW. So you know we have DPW workers who come and board up a house that we own, right? Yeah, I guess I didn't realize that either. So they like invoice the finance department? Yeah, they can. I mean, they have costs as well. Sure, sure, sure. And this isn't like: keep in mind, we say city property, but these aren't strictly city-owned properties. These are properties that we took in treasure sale and the financial interest doesn't just lie with the city, It lies with the school district and the county, Mm-hmm. So, which is why there's a separate trust fund, Got it? So DPW expends money in kind for properties that we own outright. Okay, That's their job, Got it Right. Okay, They maintain our city-owned parcels and buildings. Okay, This is not that These are separate. Now I'm understanding. Okay, so that is because these properties are not just. it'd be like if me and my three friends owned a property and there were costs, all of us and this person did work. Yep, We're all. that's how we all. it's like a joint account that we all three pay. This trust fund would be responsible for paying any like water bills if there was water turned on, Got it. Electric bills: It comes out of there. It does not come out of DPW, Got it? It's like your joint account with your spouse or whatever You're like. we pay all the family expenses out of this and then we have our own accounts for our own. That's exactly right, Right, right, right. Got it, got it, got it. Okay. So that makes a little bit more sense. Okay, So I guess I understand, and now just sort of a. so, generally speaking, because I understand, like, and you know, I'm very glad that the land bank is doing so well, So could you just overall sort of over, like last year, how many properties did the city move To sell. you know how many properties did the city sell through this process? Through this process? it's a couple hundred, which is actually the most that we've ever done. That was in 2024, Yeah, Okay. So like 200. and do we know how many we did in 2023? I'm slightly shy of that. And then, prior to that, like, well, during the COVID era, next to nothing, Okay, And then prior to that, maybe 30 properties a year, Okay, Maybe, Maybe, Yeah. So what has been the difference? Like, what's been the difference from? like 19, or just 19, 2000, I don't know- 18 between 2022? Like, what's the difference? Do you have more staff, Some of the process improved, better staff and process improvements that we have made? Okay, And granted, it's not perfect and it still is long, but it's way shorter than it has ever been and which has allowed us to actually do that. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Okay, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Okay, Okay. So, some to the URA, some to the land bank and some to, but we've significantly- It's like a third, a third, a third, so- Okay, Okay. So that's a major increase, So that's good, Okay. So now- and this is my last question, so just so I'm clear, so we're this. this bill is to refund the person their money. Yes, And from your perspective, this is not something that we do. Once it reaches, once a sale goes past council approval and the city starts to expend the money to quiet the title and to complete the sale, then anything, if you were to back out of the deal after that point in time, then the city sees it as a forfeit and we keep the hand money in order to account for any holding costs or attorney costs that we would have incurred during that time. And is that clear to the buyer up front before they? It's in the proposal, Okay, And it's in. I think it's posted even online. There's a standard sale process and I believe it's actually there as part of the standard sale process. Okay, And so, with this particular buyer, I mean, was there like some? well, I guess I don't know if it was like. I mean, I get it If it was someone who was confused or thought that it would be a great idea, I mean, you know that happens- like, oh, that'd be a great idea, Let's do it, It'll be easy, you know. And then it's like, oh my gosh, it's not. it's actually not as easy as I thought it would be. And but we're worried of like sort of like a slippery slope, like if we do it for this person, Then we would, then we open the door, Then it would be like precedence to do it for other people. That's right. And a concern is, if you allow even to transfer that money from you know this property to another one that they were wanting to purchase, what if they fell through on that purchase and then they wanted to do it to another one? Like, where does? where's the line in the sand that we draw? Do you see what I'm saying? And is the reason that we is, the reason that we take that down payment? is it because we're about to dive in and like spend a bunch of money to like quiet this title And so we don't want people just be like: oh yeah, I'll take it, sign me up. And then we spend all this money to quiet the title And then they're like: oh yeah, nevermind, Sorry, I'm not really interested. So that's what this is about. It's like. it's like you know, you have a catering business and someone's like: I'm having a big party And you're like, okay, great, Give us whatever Cause if we buy a bunch of stuff and spend a bunch of money and then you back out And they're at least compensated for what they put out. Got it In order to handle your party. Got it? Same thing, Okay, well, thanks, Same as any other real estate transaction. I mean, when you go to buy a home from a realtor, you do the same thing. Okay, You put down earnest money and start the sale process, Okay, And they use that, for it goes against, then, what you your closing costs. So, or if we were charging her 40,000, Okay, and she gave us four grand, I mean it comes off the balance of what she would owe at the closing. So, Okay, That's all the questions I have. I appreciate it. Thank you, Thanks, Councilwoman Gross. Thank you, Madam Chair, Just trying to keep my microphone on here. Thank you, Director Gula. I just want to put things in context And again for my colleagues, you've, you know, we've kind of gone over this before, so forgive me, but I think it's important for the public to kind of put these things in some kind of context, And I don't have all the numbers in front of me, Director, So we can just have ballpark numbers if you don't have them in front of you as well. But in my last recollection, looking at the entire list of properties that the three TB that we, the city, has control over in the treasurer sale inventory is what we usually call it- It was roughly about 10,000 properties. Is that still true? It's at last count. that's probably true. There could be. I mean, when we last looked at it, yes, that would be true, And I recall that some 95% or more of those were vacant lots with no structures. That's probably accurate. The largest number of those, The largest number of property holdings that we have, are vacant lots. And I mean I think I looked because for the public this is, you can export the report into a spreadsheet and you can. there are columns with codes in them And one of them says whether or not it has a structure on the lot, And I believe there were only several hundred in the entire inventory that had a structure at all. Yeah, there are very many, Yeah, okay. So I just wanted people to understand that, because I have seen conversations, either on social media, sometimes even in reporting, that make it sound like the city has thousands of actual homes And that is not the case. There may be several hundred and they're probably in conditions similar to this one. Yes, And I believe that we have prioritized moving those into the land bank. But I also want to say that, you know, I think that's you know, I think that's a good thing, I think that's a good thing, I think that's a good thing, I think that's a good thing. And I also want to put some other numbers in perspective, because, Director Gula, we had a post agenda- it might've been more than 12 months ago- where we were presenting on the just volume of transactions- because that's kind of spoken to a little bit here- reviewing how lengthy of a time there is for quiet title under the Treasurer's Sales Act. This is which is, it's all required by state law. by the way, the kinds of things that you were just describing, Yep, And the numbers I have in front of me are slightly different than, I think, that reports that you generate, because we- I pulled numbers from our city council legislation, like we have, as you point out, later on today's agenda- there's dozens of properties And so we counted up the properties going back in years And, you know, before the land bank was up and running. but even Treasurer's sale properties- I mean, you know, going back to 2019, properties like this in 2019 there were only some 24 that were moved through Treasurer's sale And a total, if you put together, transferred to the URA, either sold at side yard, sold to Treasurer's sale or other means. I mean it was something like 80 or 90 properties in 2019. It was even lower during the first years of COVID, 2020 and 2021, but that's understandable. But then when you got to be the director of finance, that volume really ramped up And the last complete year I have was 2023 and you moved some 250 properties And I don't have the numbers for 2024. Do you know generally how much it was? I think I counted half of 2024. I was already up to 130 or so. Yeah, we exceeded 2023, but I'm going to- I'm going to add something there that so, due to COVID and the courts being closed and us not being able to quiet title, we had a ton of sales that were sitting not being able to do anything. So there was a backlog. So once we moved into 2020, let's say two and three, we were processing sales that had started either slightly prior or during COVID that we could not complete, But last year we were kind of through that backlog And those were, those were sales that were specifically generated by my department. So there's a bit of a difference, you know, with 2023 or 2022. So that's a big number. We exceeded that number, Yeah. And then you also kind of put in front of us- my numbers are a little bit out of date because I, you know, one of the advantages of being remote in council is that I can have my computer up in front of me and see that. So that's a big part of that. And then the other thing that I would say that you were talking something about sales in dollars, you know, closing in on a million dollars. So that's probably the biggest teller right there of the whole story. So prior to now, not so distant past, that trust fund was underwater And the city was able to fund at least three quarters of a million dollars every single year just to pay for the budget for the three TB, which almost just relates to, like, staff and court costs. There was no extra and without that money that trust fund would have been in the negative and that there were no sales. in order to keep it going, We had to fund it, And so we were So like- I'm gonna interrupt you for a second. I'm going to say that slightly differently. The city literally lost. you know, the trust fund lost money on every property that moved. yep, got it. so since covid and the number of sales that we have put during covid, the city was like: the general fund is blah and we're not giving you money anymore for 3tb. they couldn't, so we had to sort of sink or swim on our own and we swam, and so now the balance in that trust fund is now over a million dollars. i'm going to give you a little credit here and i'm also going to say this, but i think it's factually correct: before you were the director of finance, the city was losing property money on every property it moves and the, the trust fund was in the negative. yes, and since you've been director of finance, as you said, you swam and you did not think. and now we are making money on the properties and there is about- i mean again, my numbers are a little dated, but there was about a million dollars in the trust fund. yes, there's over a million dollars in the trust fund. well, congratulations, dr gula. i just wanted to make sure because you were really great at helping us understand information at the table, but i didn't want that message to get lost, because i really really give you credit for it and i appreciate it. and you know, i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to go ahead. and you know, i've been saying, you know, i spent, had to spend 10 years wishing that things would get moving, that the land bank would get fixed. i, you know, as my colleagues recall, i i passed that legislation to create it in 2014 and it didn't move a single property. and so you know, not only has the land bank gotten fixed right, and so when we talk about, like over the last couple of years- and i think it's important to note that the land bank has moved properties- maybe more by now, right after- i'm a little behind on those counts- but you also, in addition, are moving hundreds, you know, or at least many dozens more. i don't have exactly did i cut out? i think i cut out there, sorry. in addition to the land bank sales, you are also moving properties, as the director of finance, directly to people buying them, and so that's really important information to keep in mind, and i so i don't want to say that. do you know again, i, i there's- there's not that many of those hundreds that have been moved that have structures on them. so if we only own, you know, a couple of hundred out of 10 000 that have structures, i suspect there's only a handful, like fewer than 10, maybe fewer than five, that move, that have structures on them. or or can you, can you speak to that with? i mean, without having exactly all the numbers in front of me, i would hate to like throw something out there, but i would say that most of the property is vacant land and not structures. so those are, you know, pricing structures is kind of few and far between. okay, i think that's just helpful to know because, yes, you know, maybe we want to take a closer look. i think it is some of the things that we're seeing in the industry. so, yeah, i think that's a really good point and i i think that's really important for people to understand that there's, you know, a sales agreement, just like when you're buying a house. you know there's some conditions that let you kind of back out of the deal. but you have to always read the fine print really carefully in any contract, and i'm i'm open to the discussion here, but i just wanted to put some of that in context as to like the level of of success that you've had and to put into context, i think, quite small, thank you, that's what i'm sure. thank you, thank you. we have councilwoman kayla smith, followed by councilman wilson and the things that you've done over the years. you've been really great to work with him and you do keep the city's interest. you know, front and foremost, but i- but i will say we're not. the city's budget is not great, so, but you're responsible for you're doing good, so thank you. but honestly, what i really want to know is more- and you were the assistant director too for a long time, so you've been involved in all this process for a long time- but do we have a legal opinion on this at all? because i'm wondering- there's some- you know, chatter, i'm hearing back and forth and i just want to make sure we're doing what's right here. do you have a legal opinion on this? that's saying that this is okay. so i think that's a great question. so, yeah, i'm just, i'm just Okay to move this this way Or to do this, Or what happens if I hold for a legal opinion. So I don't think we have a legal opinion on this Right now. what the administration would like to see is striking of the language. that includes a refund of hand money, which would be precedent setting. So we don't have a legal opinion. We are hopeful that there is an amendment made either in writing or a voice amendment, to strike that language. that then would clear up any legal concern. So I'm sorry, Do you mind, Madam Chair? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'll find. Thank you, thank you. I just wanted to clarify, I guess, really, what their concern is: that we will have a legal problem if we rescind the money- correct? I don't think it's a- And we don't have one now by striking it. That's not a legal, it's not a question for anybody in the legal department. But if we- If we decide to refund the money, then that's your concern as setting precedents, and then maybe that needs a legal opinion. there, I guess The concern is not legal in nature, though there may be a legal question worth exploring if that's a path we're going to go down. The concern that we've tried to highlight here is one of financial management and responsible financial management, And you know, Council Member, to your point, we're trying to act in a way that is fiscally responsible, with sort of not just the city's budget in mind, but also the 3TB trust fund that Director Gula's mentioning responsible management of that. So that's where the concerns are at- is a financial matter, not necessarily a legal matter at this time, But it could become one. But it could become one. I think I need to ask the law department this. So, if you don't mind, Madam Chair, could we maybe hold until the law department can come in, So we cannot hold this any longer, And I think there's probably someone in the chambers here who can explain why, or maybe those joining us at the table already- as to why we're up against the clock, But we really only have until next Tuesday. No, I understand until next week, but can we just hold it until the end of the meeting? is what I'm asking? I see, Until the law department comes. Hold until the end of the meeting, Yeah, because then you can take the police, get them out of here and then get the law department in here. Does that sound fair? I think we have. I don't see anybody. She was here, but I don't see anyone. We're joined by the law department today. Oh, you're with the law department. I'm sorry, You can come to the table if you don't mind. We tag each other out. man, I apologize, I didn't know You're with the law department. How are you? I'm well. thank you, Kevin Frater. I'm an assistant city solicitor. I'm standing in for Krisha Kubiak, the city solicitor. So what can I help you with? What's your question? So I'm wondering: if we do this now, will there be any legal ramifications down the road Or any consequences? legally? Well, Because we've never done this before, right To my knowledge, we have not done it before. There would be certain legal ramifications that could occur, including members of the public being able to challenge the action, Could incur court costs, could incur delays on things And, as was already said by Director Gula, this would set a precedent that could cause significant damage to the, The, The The current land bank situation, which is in good standing. So that at this point, without doing a deep dive into it, I would ask Jack Miller, who is the head of our real estate department at the law department. He may be able to give a better written opinion than I could on the matter, because he's much more familiar with the land bank issues. Can I say just say thank God for Marty Griffin making comments about our flag needing replaced, Because, as we're in the middle of the meeting, in walks the guys with the flags to replace them. So Thanks, Marty Griffin. Sorry I apologize, But you're going to watch these guys climb out the window to replace the flags, Anyway. so I'm just trying to figure out what I'm doing here. I want to make sure we're doing whatever's legally responsible and ethically responsible here, And I just don't know enough about this particular situation. I hear what you're saying, I hear what everybody else is saying And I know Councilman Calgo has a heart of gold. I tell him there's somebody who is homeless that needed a job and he offered him a roofing job. So I mean, he's just And he's constantly taking care of people, And I think I just want to make sure that whatever we're doing here is legally responsible. So I can abstain today, unless others want to get a legal opinion. Would you think a legal opinion would be helpful in this? That's up to you. I don't get to make the determinations or the decisions. Do you think it would be helpful? He'll know. I think that Jack would be able to give you a much more in-depth dive than I can. Are you OK with that. I'm fine with that. We can get it by Tuesday, Before Tuesday, And we'll have the knowledge about then which way. OK, So you can move it for today. Whoops, I'll abstain. You can move it forward. If the legal opinion comes back negative in a way that we can't move forward, then we can kill it next week, Table it next week, Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman. We have Councilman Wilson. Thank you, Chair. Before our legal office leaves the table, I just wanted to ask- I wasn't planning on asking about this, but the land bank came up several times in the comments- And how does this put the land bank at risk? Or are you actually trying to say the finance department? So the land bank trust fund is what I was discussing, And the land bank trust fund, The three taxing bodies Trust fund. I think you mean three taxing bodies, I'm sorry. Yes, The three taxing bodies trust fund. That's in there And that's where the money. Thank you, No problem, Yeah, OK, Yeah, That's all good. I just wanted to clear that up. I like it. Nice, Thanks, Thanks, I just wanted to- Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. Just recognize that I appreciate the work of the Director Gula and the finance department And everyone that works there Out of your hands is what the situation is that's before us, Which is just the length of time that it would take to. I mean, maybe some of it's in your hands. I'm not trying to pick through that now, But Yeah, Yeah, Just in general, the length of time that the buyer would have to wait from the time they see the property, The time they could actually get in and start repairing the property, is, I mean, that's the issue In this case, I believe, The years that go by until they can get in and repair the roof. And that's also more reason to Why people Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. That's why people choose Without words right now, but it's, it's not eminent domain, It's the Conservatorship. That's why people choose conservatorship sometimes to get in sooner and report back to the judge on what the progress is. And I'm also hearing From some of my colleagues- Just, You know- celebrating the finance department, which is great. I mean I, I love more tax revenue, But we also have to be mindful. I know that this is a constant topic. And I'm also hearing from my colleagues- you know, just, You know- celebrating the finance department, which is great. I mean I, I love more tax revenue, But we also have to be mindful. I know that this is a constant topic. I know that this is a constant topic, But we also have to be mindful- I know that this is a constant topic here, But we also have to be mindful- I know that this is a constant topic here- At the table of, You know, selling to speculators or Predatory, You know future landlords or You know anyone that would, You know wholesale or speculator. So we, you know currently there's no. I mean, I'm happy to Understand if I'm incorrect here, but my understanding is we just have to sell to, To the, You know, to the highest bidder. It would be, It'll be. I don't know, It's just, It's just not that we could do that. I mean, we we incorrect here, but my understanding is we just have to sell to the, to the, you know, to the highest bidder when we sell at the city and if there's not a you know like a responsible buyer process, is that, is that correct, director? that's, that's not entirely true. first of all, someone has to be vetted in order to become a purchaser, which means we look, they fill out an application and we have to make sure that that either company or individual does not have any open pli violations and they do not owe any municipal liens or open tax dollars to the city. second, then that property is actually vetted for the use that that person actually enters in on their application. so the planning department- there's a, there's a property committee that looks at the application and then they look at the application and then they look at the application and then they look at the application and then they look at the application and then they look at that and says, okay, is, is this parcel what they want to use it for? apt for the end use after where it's located and does it. you know, as long as it fits in with, maybe, what the community plan is and they're approved to buy it, then yes, we can definitely sell to anybody. we we have to. yes, we have to. it's sort of part of the check with the community before you sell property. yeah, oh, there's community plans. i'm not aware, i'm not aware of that. i have a couple pieces of property that we had on item street that you know. i guess i wasn't aware you, you emailed the community group or how does that happen? there's, there's actually a working group of individuals that will reach out to community groups. they reach out to zoning and city planning and then they either approve the property for sale for what the end use is, based on the application. i'm sorry. you said there's a committee. yep, oh, i'm sorry, director, you said there was a committee. that i'm sorry. i'm sorry if you didn't hear me. there is, it's. there's a review process of the property itself and its end use. yeah, i know, but you're not going to be able to get that right. you're going to have to do it yourself. you just said you contact the community. so what's what's the process with the community? there's for the community. they reach out to community groups or like if, if city planning actually has a community plan, that's there. they will vet that parcel for its end use against what the plan is, and that's just that's something we have in our code, or that's just something that appalled. it's a policy and it's been in practice for a number of years, probably since, i want to say, at least 2018- okay, not prior- we recently worked with for iton street. they didn't mention any of this, so i'm curious to know more about this. i didn't realize that we had a robust process at this at the city. you know, my understanding is that i mean, i'm totally unaware of this, because there's a house across the street from me on spring hill that was purchased and i don't no one talked to this person, i mean the, quite frankly, the land bank reached out to them to understand what they were going to do with it. so i'm curious to know what you know more about what you're talking about. i've i've never heard of this. they purchased the property for the because they were the highest bidder. i mean, you know? i mean, yeah, i definitely think we should check on whether or not they're paying the taxes and if they have a violation. but anyway, my point was just that you know, there is a lot of concern that you know, i know a lot of council members have brought up in the past about speculation, wholesale buyer buyers and everything. i just want to point out that and i'm happy to learn more about this process that that i'm not aware of. but anyway, i was going to try and just talk about the land bank and how. you know, there, we, you know there is a board, there is public meetings about these process, about these pro, about the process of how we vet buyers and you know, to really fund the land back long term. my, you know my understanding- that would be like the best practice to go forward with. so i just want everyone to keep in mind that the land bank isn't funded past 2026 and i'm going to be setting up a series of meetings to fund the land bank long term and make it sustainable. so if you're interested in being a part of those meetings, please reach out to me. and you know, i just want to want to highlight, you know, one way that we can, you know, have a bit, have a greater control over not having to sell to the highest bidder and making sure that these properties are being in the right place and that they are being in the right place to be. so that's, that's, get in the right hands. so, thank you, can i just clarify for one moment please? so selling to the highest bidder, we kind of have to do that. these properties are taken via treasurer sale. we sell to the highest bidder to recuperate costs that we've already lost, or tax dollars that were not collected, or costs that were expended for demolition or cleanup that were never paid. so that's point number one. point number two: just because we start a sale with a specific individual and the property and the individual was vetted for that sale. people can object to that sale. so this vetting process happens in the very beginning. there could be other objectors to that sale that we would vet as individuals to make sure that they could individually object to the sale, meaning they don't owe the city any more money, but they could also through a court auction process. once it gets so far and there are objectors, then it would go to the highest bidder through a court auction, which means the person that started the sale with us that you approved at city council may not be the one that actually ends up with the property, but that is part of the treasurer sale act. this. these are things that we cannot control, because the point of taking the properties in the beginning is to recuperate lost tax dollars or municipal costs. does that answer your question? is that an projection that we're putting aside? even though we're using the details here, it doesn't help explain some une güzelball that is currently going on at the city. once it gets to a certain point in the quiet title process, we can't accept any more objectors. but if there are objectors to the sale, we post them publicly, not only here in city council, and they may do communities if there have to be any arable tenants or to provide trabajables, we post the location and the 32-00 tenant sale that realimposed breasts by law types and the property documentation services. the sale is going on at 7. 3 when you have to go by process and the Harris altered. so i have a lot of tamamlex nursing services to close at the individual svl with the rubles register etc. so, basically, or the the property And they're advertised to the public. They're advertised publicly, not only here in city council and they go as part of legislation, but they're advertised as part of the quiet title process And in fact people that border or are adjacent to the property that's being sold receive a letter and notifying them that the property is being sold and they too could object to the sale and purchase it for 10,000 And then they can go and get the money down just like everybody else and start a sale. So there's a person who won the bidding process. Do they have to pay that price or higher? They have to pay what they bid The bidding. once it goes to court auction, it's held by a judge in a courtroom. there's an opening bid, which is usually the starting cost of the sale that we started and then anybody who's interested in buying the property we're going to give them. There's no hand money. No, they put down hand money in order to be an objector. I'm hearing judge, I'm hearing highest bidder. I just wish we would just talk about just what we have to do by law in terms of the city. Councilman, if I think I'm understanding what you're asking about and the point you're trying to make, so correct me if I'm wrong, but I do believe that there is a more, I do believe there is a more robust community driven process that the land bank has as part of their sales process, as compared to the one that is within the city's process. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah, I just I'll leave it go. I just don't understand why we went down this road of talking about the land bank and talking about this other process that I have no idea, But I'm sure there are properties that have been on the books for some time and the you know there is like more engagement on it. but I mean, the fact of the matter is we have to sell to the highest bidder and I was just trying to bring a light to another process, that we have another tool, that we have the land bank and that you know, although I do think we should still like I'm in the camp where we should still continue selling property through the finance department. that's not what I'm trying to do here. I'm just trying to talk about, bring a highlight about this other tool we have and how it's not funded past 2026 and how those are the concerns of the table here at city council. for literally the majority of the time I've been on council, I hear you know these concerns all the time. So sorry this got a little long-winded, but I just feel like we got a little off track there. Thanks, Thank you, Councilman. Thank you, I don't know if we're going to go into second round. I'm sure we will, but I do have a couple of questions and, at the risk of asking questions, I know there are council members who have really delved into this process, worked with the finance department to make it as sort of efficient as possible, thus resulting in the many, many property increases that we've seen over the years. So I'm just trying to get at like the concern we have before us today without actually talking about this particular issue. I think it's very clear that the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the interested in the property, in part because of the structure. Have you had these conversations with whoever it is- PLI, DPW- to say these need to be at the top of the list for roof repairs, for building stabilization, Because, like someone's literally interested in getting it back on the tax rolls and paying taxes? Have you had those conversations? Do you know if they do prioritize that or if there's some mechanism that we could help with, separate from this bill, to help get those prioritized so that they can be at least? if the process is gonna take a year, 18 months, et cetera. we know that we're going as fast as we can- and you certainly are, and the courts are as well- that at least the building will be stabilized in the meantime. So I wouldn't say necessarily a lot of formal conversation specifically on that topic, but there are a number of us that do meet to talk about our inventory and mostly about vacant land. but these types of conversations do come up and it does usually involve finance, the law department, because they also have a real estate division as well- PLI, DPW and the land bank, And so I think that's part of how we all work together, because some of those parcels that the land bank is interested in are ones that they know that they could take and turn around and may not be in the conditions that they're in, And so that's part of the process. And then we also have the URA, and I'm not gonna say that they're not interested, but they are interested in a lot of the work that we're doing in the URA and that would be suitable for us to actually sell to someone else. but they also have a group of investors too that are capable of doing that type of work. So I wouldn't say it's necessarily formal, but those things are taken into consideration when we do talk as a group about how to improve our processes overall between all of us, because we as a city we have to make sure that we're able to get to the point that we can do that We're able to get to the point where we can do that in order to work through the inventory and get it off the rules and back into people's hands and profit generating again. so Do you think some sort of policy, whether it's policy, internal policy within the city's director's purview or actual formal legislation, would help, Or would that be too restrictive to say just sort of say, wait to formalize it. is it good, Is it not? what is an informal conversation right now? Well, the biggest concern that I have is the fact that, at least for us, it has to come out of a trust fund that is just getting healthy and it's always really come down to the cost of it. So, while we've made great strides and came a long way from where we were, I don't think we're in necessarily a position where we could really go out and expend a large amount of money, because a lot of these fixes aren't going to be cheap in order to assist in property stabilization, which is why we've utilized the land bank to put those things in their hands, because they're capable of doing it where we're not. And then I'm trying to be fair to the city and fair to the person who's bidding In situations like this. I get that it's pretty rare where there's been a request to return haystacks. I don't know if it's because of the sale being rescinded or falling through. What I'm hearing is that we know we spend money, but maybe we don't track it granularly enough to know how much of that- say 4,000- is being spent in the process. What I'm getting at is: could there be a splitting- not today necessarily, but in the future- a way to account for that, to then be able to return some of the money that has been unspent. I don't know if that's even possible to calculate in each of these instances. I mean we could look into it. It might be in the future, not necessarily for this one, but potentially Okay. Okay, Just thinking of all the ideas. again, these are probably questions people have asked in your group, in your task force, in the various departments, on council. I'll just sort of. I'll just sort of, you know, encountering this part of it for the first time, I will reserve any my future questions for later and move to second round, I believe, unless we have others. So we'll start with Councilman Coghill. Thank you, Madam Chair. I just have a few questions. I promise I'm not gonna keep you here long, Too late for that, I know. But I want you to know this is not a reflection. You're doing exactly what I want you to do as a director. You need to protect that fund. It's like getting it to the board. You need to protect that fund. You need to protect that fund. I'm not gonna keep getting it from the jaws of death with you, which is great, We want that right. We want you to be a fiscal watchdog. But let me ask you, this director Of that fund, a million dollars so we put in a third. Where is? is our? is that completely in the city's hands, that money? So the- because it's always been in the, operated in the negative pretty much the city- any of the, any of the proceeds that were actually made back into the trust fund just to like cut grass- And we even know that in the past, like the maintenance cost, even expending, that has been, and you know there's employees that get paid out of there as well for the work that they do, specifically on property sales. Yeah, I understand why you're protecting them. So there's not really. yeah, So the money that's generated, there's really nothing extra, right, But it's three TB, that's three taxing bodies. Yep, Does the school district? does the school district how it makes that money or The way it should operate is is: yes, they would, but we would also be required to profit, share with them as well. Okay, So they could contribute, but we'd also be responsible for paying them. But they don't contribute, But we don't pay them either. Okay, okay, There's no, there's no proceeds to share. Got it, got it. So the money that's there just keeps getting recycled, Okay, yeah, So so I wanted to go back to 200 and say what is there? 250 structures, is that somewhere in the ballpark Or no, I'm sorry, three, four, maybe even up to 500, but no more than 500. We said 95% is really land right? Probably So. and then you clear 250 and 23, So we've got to get be getting close to what. do we have a couple hundred left, 250 sales, not Sales, But that includes buildings and land, Oh Right, Okay. well, there you go, Of which most of them were probably vacant, I understand, right, right, So you sell more land or more building, more land, Well, more land, mostly because the volume of the actual inventory is mostly land and not buildings. Got it right. So we still have hundreds of structures, I'm sure. And, to be clear, these structures are probably dead end properties when we get them. Absolutely right, right, That sat vacant for a number of years, So they're not in good condition ever, I know. and that's my next question is: how many do we acquire every year that fall into our hands? basically, right, So not many On an average. I think the last treasurer sale maybe we had 50 parcels available, but we weren't actually putting parcels in a treasurer sale unless we knew that there was a buyer that wanted them. So Okay, and ones that we're acquiring now. the idea, hopefully, is that get those going directly into the land bank as well. And, like Mr Wilson noted, you know the land bank is going to need money And that's one thing you have right now, which is fortunate. The land bank and the URA, and if there are community groups, would work through the land bank, They request us to put properties that they want in their inventory that they know are tax delinquent. We expose them to a treasurer sale, We take them and then we transfer them to them. But there's also individual buyers that would apply and we would take those as well, And they could either come to the sale and bid on them or buy them once we take them into our hands. Okay, and I wanted to clarify one thing, Councilman Wilson- and I think I have this right, but you too, I think I have this right, but you too, I think I have this right, but you too correct me if I'm wrong- Objectors can spark an auction if they object, correct? Yep, Okay, Once they spark that auction, if that objector goes and put, well, first of all, they have to put their hand money down. If they go to that auction and they do not get the winning bid, then they get their money back, correct, Okay, because I've done that right. So that's no harm, no foul there, Right, As far as objectors go, Right, It's the people that we are dealing with. through the City of Pittsburgh and our process, I feel like- And again it really comes down to this- The place is rotting before, after they put their hand money down. It you know and I understand your, I understand where you're at. I do, I understand your position, I really do. So it just needs to be a bigger, broader conversation. And this did happen. I know we've refunded. you said once, but I'd like to call it Peter. come on up here, McDevitt, if I can. Madam Chair, He has some history, I think, or I don't know if once, but twice, you said once this, somebody was refunded, And I'm not going to keep your hair forever. And Kevin, I don't know if anybody else has anything for you. We can call you back up if they do. I just like being part of the table. Okay, good deal, good deal. Well, I was going to maybe occupy your seat with Sean, but go ahead, Peter, please. Hi, Peter McDevitt, City Council Budget Director. So something that jumped out at me is talking about how this would be setting a new precedent. Maybe my understanding of the word precedent is different, but we have done this at least twice in the last three years. So council has initiated legislation to rescind the sale and the hand money is to be refunded. Do you have the amounts of that hand money? I don't have the amounts of it. Okay, all right, that's fine. It was at the end of 2022 when Reverend Burgess sponsored legislation and then, 18 months ago, Council President Lavelle sponsored legislation to rescind the sale and to refund the hand money. So that's at least twice within the last three years. So it's not a new thing. So the fair- possibly the administration or anybody you, Director, I guess- is that it would set precedents and open us up to a legal challenge. Glad you're here, Kevin, But if we have done it in the past, Then it's not unprecedented. It's not precedents, right? Well, sorry, I don't think. appreciate Peter bringing up legislation, but I don't think we've had a chance to review the legislation and understand the sale that it related to- and it is likely not an apples to apples comparison- Previous legislation that's been put in front of me, as prior examples have not been apples to apples comparisons under this administration. What I've seen are examples of, like Director Gula said, where either the city is at fault and unable to complete the sale or there is some sort of objection or dispute, but it's not the individual applicant who is applied who is then backing out once we're ready to complete a sale. Fair enough. There's no way that you can confirm that's the case. I do. Right, okay, fair enough. fair enough. Yeah, right, so Okay, I guess I'm going to. I don't know what other members are going to do. I've had this conversation with really other members other than a couple brief. you know notes and again, it's more the principle for me. So I'm willing to bite the bullet and pay the four grand back. We do have a million dollars. We don't want to make precedents of this. We don't have that many structures where people can come back to us for millions of dollars, right, I mean, we only have a million dollars, Right, We only have a couple hundred structures. So at worst, if there's five others out there that say, hey, I wanted my money back, you know, so you know how much could it cost us in the end. But ultimately we need to do some interior. you know, reorganization, I think more than anything here. But I appreciate what you do. I appreciate your stance on this. I love you protecting our money like I really do. I want you to know I respect that. okay, So okay, but that's it for me, madam, Madam chair, so thank you very much And thank you for being here. Thank you, And I know Council Member Warwick had her hand up first and then Councilwoman. oh no, no, you were just asking Gotcha. Councilwoman Kale-Smith, Just briefly. I initially had a lot of concern because I thought we never did this. I asked if we never did this before And I'm finding out now that we did it just twice in the past few months. But I talked to somebody else and it's been seven times over the past few years and some of it has been initiated by your department and some by city council. So now I feel a little bit more comfortable with moving forward. That's it for me, thank you. Thank you. Any further discussion Seeing none. all those in favor of Bill 1634, please indicate by saying aye, Aye, Aye. Opposed abstentions: Abstain. I'm gonna abstain as well. Any abstentions? Affirmative recommendation That moves us on to new papers. Great job, guys. Bill 17: I'm sorry we are gonna take a little diversion from the regularly scheduled program and move over to Public Safety and Wellness Committee, At the request of our attendees today chaired by Councilman Coghill. Bill 1703: Bill 1703: Resolution authorizing the mayor, the director of the Office of Management and Budget and the director of the Department of Public Safety to enter into an agreement or agreements with the County of Allegheny for the purpose of receiving grant funds from the 2023 National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative Grant and the amount not to exceed 37,000 to support overtime for PBP detectives for the investigation of old sexual assault cases, the purchasing of materials to properly furnish assault like prost irradiation abuse. Tommy Moh andEPcium Vic Deients. We again return to Public Safety and Wellness Committee's transportation documentation. In summary, Quinn truly, trabajo en Catuac con porú. questions about: I just wanted to make sure you came up and you know address if any other members had had anything, but it seems pretty self-explanatory. thirty seven thousand dollars, unless you want to explain it. yeah, it's just, we're seeking reimbursement. Allegheny County Medical Examiner's Office actually obtained the grant and we are a sub awardee. we did work for them on. the dissident is an extension of the grant that they got in 2019. we did work for them on an overtime basis some of it, so they thought that we should receive reimbursement for it. so when they got the extension, they put in for a sub-awardee for us to receive, you know, no more than thirty six thousand dollars for overtime and then a thousand dollars for us to furnish a soft interview room. so we're just looking for reimbursement that work that we're going to do anyway. understood, thanks, commander. Thank You, councilmember Charlin. yeah, thank you for being here. I just understand this. I'm mm-hmm very supportive of any time we're getting grants for anything, but we are paying for work that we've already done. or is this is a reimbursement for work that we've already done? no, well, we've done some of the work already. this is work to be done, yet we have identified the kids that we have in our property room that are untested. most of that work was done with on-duty personnel. okay, reports were printed and pulled to give to the coordinator's office. coordinator of this sake. grant for the county. that took some overtime hours. we have marked those as reimbursed. have not sought reimbursement yet, but those were overtime hours that were already spent the the next part of the process is when they ask for the kids to be sent to the crime lab, we pull them, write reports, transport them. that's where the bulk of the work is going to come in and then any follow-up investigations that follow. and just out of curiosity, what is a? what is a soft interview? around right now we have interview rooms that are basically for very cold and sterile, consists of a desk and a chair. those are recorded rooms, not not very conducive for victim interviews. gotcha, we take them into conference room sometimes. other times take them into these sterile rooms. so in the short term was more like a gathering to have contact with the. So a softer room with a couch, some soft furnishings make it a little more easy for them to relax and tell their story, as opposed to a sterile environment. Sure, that makes sense. All right, thank you very much, Thank you. any further questions? And I apologize, I didn't quite catch if you said your name and your- I did not.

That moves us to Public Works and Infrastructure Committee, chaired by Council Member Warwick. Bill 1712 resolution authorizing the mayor and the director of the Office of Management and Budget and the director of the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure to apply for the P cards. Bill 1712 resolution authorizing the mayor and the director of the Office of Management and Budget and the director of the Office of Management and Budget and the director of Management and Infrastructure to apply for grant funding from the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources Community Conservation Partnership Program to provide funding for the rehabilitation of Emerald View Trail project. The grant proposal includes an ask of 250,000 with a match of 250,844. 42 from the City of Pittsburgh's capital budget, for a total project cost of 500,844. 42 for this stated purpose. Upto the proposed plan was reached and approved by the Council for king structure in Pike County is a transit security union with the ability to review and interoperability attraction. To apply for the plan, it is not requiring changes in fundsutatic or grants- is legally redundant. have 300,000 in the 2024 capital budget. that's for design. this 250,000, the grant that we're going after, is for the construction portion of the project, so that would be about a 500,000 and then we might have to put in additional ask in the 2025 capital or 2026 budget for the rest of the construction of that project. I'm just and you've had. I just want to be clear. you've had meetings with the. there's a committee, the parks committee, for the Emery View Parks trail committee. you've had meetings with them, but have you had meetings with the general public with outside of that committee? that group? we have no, I believe, can do that. yeah, I want you to do that, because every time we do a project, somebody's saying that's not the project that's most important. or somebody saying who had who, who made these decisions and it people don't attend meetings if they're not part of a committee, but yet they still care about the project. I'm not saying that's not the case, but I'm saying that's the case. I'm saying that's what we're doing and we're doing it in a way that's not going to be a bad thing. So I think we should be. I think we need to do better at meeting with the residents and getting out there and talking with them about a lot of the projects we're doing, and this is one of them. but one of the most important projects for that community is the Shaler Park renovations for the Eileen McCoy Park on Shaler, and I did- we did things for the council. we did just put forward a 500,000 project to help them with the Eileen McCoy project and we've been working with the Eileen McCoy and the City of Shaler Park on this project for a long time and we've been talking to the City of Shaler Park on that and we've been talking to the members of the City of Shaler Park on that and they've been saying they want to have that park renovated, so if we could do a project. I know that's very important to the community, but I think I'd like to hear from the community which is their most important priorities. So- and I know they're different departments, different things, but at the same time, I want to prioritize the public, the things with I want to engage them. I want them to have an opportunity. Listen, I get frustrated sometimes when it comes be experts in public safety who help direct that. i think you should give them some feedback, but i don't know they should have every comp. they should control every comment or every project, but when it comes to things like their playgrounds and parks and things like that, i think we should be try to do a little bit more engagement in those areas. but i do appreciate that they at least try to get a committee together. they have the feedback online that you can give, but sometimes people aren't familiar with using the online source. you know resources. so, thank you. i want to thank you for the work that you've done across our district. thank you, you've been great. that's it. thank you, council member warwick, did you have a question? yeah, thanks, so that that just you know your comments from reminded me one thing, and i know that we've talked about it, but i really think that, going forward, we need to kind of solidify process wise is i would say. over the past few years, there has definitely been a shift, at least in my experience right in my district. right, there has been a major shift in the amount of engagement between the city and the community, which is great, like it's, it's wonderful, like the neighborhood services team is so nice to have people there. however, right when- and this is something i've experienced right is it's like when the city is so accessible, like in community, right there you do get the things like: well, i wasn't at the meeting, yeah, and i didn't know about that meeting, even though there were so many meetings. so it's, it's almost like we're in a, in sort of like it's like a mesh between the before and after. and i think that now we really need a solidified where we are saying on, on and- and i know it would be different depending on the size of the project, right, but where we are making abundantly clear up front. you know, it'd be nice to just have a standard template right, based on project size, but like, this is the project and we are going to have X number of meetings. the first meeting is gonna be input. you know, whatever it is right, like just hypothetically, like the first meeting is gonna be input on design. what would you like to see right? the next meeting is gonna be: this is the but making it clear, like this is the design that we paid for and this is it. and now we're like just showing it to you and then this right to, so that it's very clear for folks what our process is. because I've noticed and you know, and- and it's no fault of the public, right, because they don't understand- and our workings. but like, where there's confusion, where it's like, for example, we're at a stage where we've gotten our permits and we're going to bid, and then they're like, well, could, but could we like make a- you know what I mean- like we'd like to see like a different window or a door, and it's like to make that change would mean like go back to the pre-permitting. so it's like to really make it clear from the outset what the engagement process is going to look like. and you don't I mean and so that, so that then when folk I mean, we do our best to let people know. but if we could say up front: this is, these are all the things that you can expect. you know that there's a lot of things that we can expect and we can expect in terms of engagement and then at the very least, then when someone comes, you know, at the tail end and says, wait a minute, I was there, at least we can say okay. well, actually, you know these are all the meetings that we had and I know that's on the engage page, but I don't know just if there's a way to kind of formalize that process depending on project size. thanks, thank you. any further discussion? seeing none. all those in favor of bill 1712? please indicate by saying aye. affirmative recommendation bill 1713. bill 1713 resolution authorizing the mayor and the director of the Department of Public Works to enter into an agreement and or amendments with the University of Pittsburgh for the purpose of providing supplemental waste operations in the Oakland neighborhood at no cost to the city. second second discussion: it was that this is the request of the department. okay, great. all those in favor of a one-week hold: please indicate by saying aye. aye, bill be held for one week. that moves us on to land use and economic development committee chaired by councilman Wilson. supplemental papers. bill 1738: ordinance amending a Pittsburgh code of ordinance. amendment of traffic in the direction of the one sized meva park building parking. tragically charges all those in favor seven mainbeno information. asking any further questions? is there something? I'm sorry, was the applicant going to be the item talking about all of their services? that committee, yesatem, that summit was the one. the recommendation is to closed the after meeting. why we had 3 to 0 discussion by millers was the right number. the current record was 2. America's mostiuous parkinguche of buildings during fiscal year has been za month following workers management have wares, property, WH, car injured or ASL Tahoe. he's the. So it's your committee Councilman. We do have some people here in person and these are the next two bills. They're ones that also Angela Martinez is available online for, so well covered. Okay, Let me see here. So I missed that. Are we waiting for someone to come to the table? Nope, you can ask your questions. We're ready to go, All right. so for Bill 1738, I want to thank the sponsor. I know that he's worked hard on this And I just wanted to ask about future districts that could be created, and specifically there's one on the north side that you know we've been discussing with Domi and the parking authority and if I could get some clarity on whether or not this would affect that district. So I'm going to go ahead and ask that question. Yeah, Rylan Seifert, Curbside Program Manager with Domi Councilman, this is going to be used in very narrow circumstances. For context, Domi only took over the RPP program in the beginning of 2022, so this is the first time that we're actually here to do a minor expansion of an RPP zone And, as we've managed your RPP program over the past few years, we've noticed a few of these little tweaks that need to be made to the code language. So installing limited amounts of RPP signage in non-residential areas is something that there's already precedent for in a few different neighborhoods, a few different streets, for that context makes sense. Also in hybrid RPP areas, which is something that the code allows for. that we haven't implemented any of yet. So it's really just to give us that opportunity. That's not something that I expect us to do on a wide arranging basis, really on a block by block, case by case basis, And I don't see how this would have any impact to the kind of parking enhancement district conversations that we've been having. Okay, great, Yeah, I'm happy that we're using that. Okay, So the hybrid option: I know that we included that when we worked together, Ryland, in the past on the bill that I put forward and this council voted for. So good to see this coming to fruition on the south side And so, in terms of this, wouldn't affect anything. I just want to be clear that this is under a section 549-09- posting signs indicating restrictions- enforcement. So the line where it says it talks about signs, it's in bold and the text: signs may only be posted in regulations enforced in non-residential zoning districts. So is this, is this just reinforcing the code that was already written, that we wrote together years ago, Or is this new language that only? it just doesn't look like it's specific to. I mean, it's under B, so it is specific to these. It is mentioned. these other areas are mentioned on the south side. I just want to make sure that this doesn't change, Okay, So I'm just going to go ahead and get back to that. Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay. Thank you for that. I have layers in this new license form And this version of the CH of fighting agency for some reasons. Many colleagues say that there are timeãün area where there is this. you know it's like before we had hybrid. well, this would be the first hybrid, but you know there was some different signage there that exists that doesn't exist anywhere else, And so that's just one example that comes to mind. Yeah, Good, We would not be adjusting any other signage retroactively in existing RPP zones. Okay, All right. Well, thank you for your time And I don't have any further questions. Thanks, Thank you, Council Member Sharlin. Yeah, So thank you guys for being here, Just to make sure everybody's aware of what all has gone on here. This is related to a development that's in the south side that we have been working to try to get from. Actually, the project was entitled in 20. Before I even mentioned I was a staffer- Entitled, was sold to someone else, was titled again, was The residents appealed the entitlement to the appellate courts? This is a compromise that we found between the constituents, the developers and the city being a tri-party, And we're going to have to make a tri-party lawsuit there, And this is the step that we need in order to get the residents on board with building this project. that is truly just an underutilized alleyway that during the pandemic, people were doing peel-outs and car shows unauthorized and some really dangerous stuff happening there. But this is the step that we need. I'm very thankful that the development group was willing to stick themselves out here and commit to doing this for so long. I think a lot of other people with less deep pockets would have walked away, But we've met with this group literally every Friday for almost a year now to try to find a way to get a compromise. We've had a standing meeting. I think that Domien- Because this is one portion of the One portion of the problem- There's also been a traffic calming component that Domien has had to work through as well. But thank you for your commitment to see this through. But this is a ton of work that went through from our end. that is Again I cannot reiterate enough- additional costs that is put onto the developer. that will then- They will then recoup in increased rents And really speaks to like how challenging this is. I think that's a big part of the problem. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Right, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Right. So I think one of theke's been really supportive And something that I've learned from working a bit on the African Island is that we've just been given the opportunity to open the airport tutti so that we can actually just go- appeared install rooms, You know, preset a furnishing and that there's more to happen was to want to maintain those facilities and, as our entities, these is not seen as an actual tenant. this is ultimately not going to be a real tenant, Right? So it's just something that's definitely going to come through, Thank you, Thank you.

Motion to hold five weeks. Second Discussion, Seeing none. Councilwoman Strasburg, sorry, I didn't have time to raise my hand, Absolutely. Councilmember Gross, Thank you, I appreciate it. Thank you, curious kind of what is going on with this bill. i feel like it's actually been on the agenda many months now. yes, yes, it has, and i remember. i mean, this is the same bill that councilman connell and i asked to kind of go through a process last year. i believe i don't have the whole legislative record in front of me- and then it did and i haven't had an update on it. so i'm wondering if, if there's anyone who can from the administration, who can speak to it, i can provide an update interrogatory. yes, okay, yeah, so there was an email from kelly russell and i can just kind of summarize this. basically, last wednesday, i'm sorry, if we refresh our memory, this was just. you know, this was a property in the councilman charles district and there was- there was many, there was meetings about this. we had an on-site meeting and on that on-site meeting it came out that there was some miscommunication or lack of communication between different governmental entities and so there's a new application that had to be done and last wednesday hud read the bill and they said they were going to go through the process and they're going to go through the process and they're going to go through the process and they're going to go through the process and they're going to go through the process and they're going to go through the reviewing the draft's substantial amendment with a perfect reference for homeless families in our home arpa plan, and they have a meeting scheduled with consultants at urban design ventures tomorrow at 11 to plan out the official substantial amendment process. this includes placing a newspaper ad, holding public meeting and having a 15-day column period. i'm hope we can, and so they can continue to email saying like, just, i hope that they can get a five-week hold so they can figure this out. i'm just recalling, actually, as i pulled it up- i mean again, i think it was councilman collins and i first kind of questioned it- it was july of 2024 and we were disappointed because of the federal rules. the federal rules, and it says it right in the title: it's for non-congregate and so we were hoping that it would be conducive for use for one of the tiny house communities that could be put up quickly, cheaply. again, members have heard us talk about it for several years. right that, if you can put up kind of 50 tiny houses, like 100 other cities have done, that you can house people more quickly. it's easier than converting a building. but alas, almost all of those have shared bathroom facilities. you have a bathroom trailer, which can be very fancy. have showers, have toilets, can be really, really nice, but unfortunately the federal rules still call those congregate. and this, these little pot of money, it's not so little, but it is little when you're talking about creating homes or temporary housing or anything is 1. 5 million. thanks for watching another day. what we did remember, one of the things that i wanted to make clear was that the technical piece of it was not asking for the temporary house to be too small. it was asking for whichever way it was going to be designed. so we were, i was concerned that we'd be having to support an urbanWow operation internationally. so we finally tasty design the small apartment. we're going to build a 3. 7 m2 tiny house with five urbanWpeople. I mean again, it's been held since July of 2024. So I just wanted to say that you know, let's figure out what the obstacles are, And that's all I'll say, Madam Chair, Thank you, I appreciate it. Thank you, Is there any further discussion on the motion to hold five weeks. Madam Chair, Councilman Wilson, Yeah, if anyone's interested in getting you know more details, reach out to the administration or Kelly Russell. And you know this is a- I'm not sure how it relates to the tiny house legislation, but this is, yeah, this is from my understanding. this is just following the process. This isn't my bill, This is. This was something the administration was trying to get done And then come to find out that the county, the administration, had an idea of what was going to be, you know who was going to be housed in this, in this building, a building that would have to be rehab, And then another county on site said: no, we don't, We plan to house families here. So yep, If anyone wants any further information, I can Certainly facilitate anything where you can certainly just reach out to Kelly Russell as well. Thanks, Thank you very much.

I've looked this up and I was trying to figure this out myself. Oakland's one, five, two, one, three. yeah, there's one in homewood. let's see, here we can look this up pretty quickly. just one here. yeah, you, you. so this looks like it is indeed in District three and perhaps we need a. I don't see any other. Mckee place is 296. McKee place is coming up, so perhaps we need a voice amendment to change the zip code, to correct the zip code. okay, five, two, one, three. looks like it was a small typo. yeah, I just pulled up the attachments in the legislation, any attachments for one, five, two, one, three. okay. okay, that makes more sense. then there's a project there. so would someone like to make a motion to strike one, five, two, three, two from the title of the bill? and you can see if it's necessary? madam clerk, we were able to see if it was necessary in the body of the bill as well, and in the title and in the body of the bill it's throughout any. so every place that that exists, one, five, two, three, two- change to one, five, two, one, three. can we do that? is that yes, are we able to do that as a vote, to make that motion to replace one, five, two, three, two to one, five, two, one, three in the title and all throughout the bill? second discussion: all those in favor of amending the bill as stated. please indicate by saying aye, aye. bill is amended. discussion on amended bill. seeing none. all those in favor of bill 1704 as amended? please indicate by saying aye, aye, aye, affirmative recommendation. thank you for catching that council person. bill 1705. bill 1705 resolution adopting plan revision to the city of Pittsburgh's official sewage facilities plan for 215 South 21st Street at no cost to the city. second discussion: everything happens in district three.

I think I looked up the attachments to this one on the map and I'm not sure where it is. it's on. it's definitely, I think, in the West End, near the West End town or traffic circle. so I was wondering if anyone can speak. councilman Smith maybe knows that this is that one, or does anyone know kind of like which? yeah, there's gonna be many of these, these, these things. these are just curious, these parcels that are coming forward or either on the north side. some of them will be on the north side, right under the West End bridge, and some will be over in the West End near the Pataglia old former dumping site. and this is for the West End. well, it's for Alka Sam, but it will also be part of the project for the West End bridge and the the renovations underneath. it's supposed to mirror what's happening on the north side, but it'll be under the West End bridge. I hope I live to see it. it's a great project. thank you, appreciate that. it's not enough. this is on the Clark side, or do we need to send it. I'm not even sure which you can. you can look at since these over and maybe we just asked them to give us some some Geographic bearing and the title of the bill. just, you know, update on it more helpful. okay, not a problem for the properties. when we get legislation for Alka San, a lot of times they don't include the parcel and the addresses. but we'll reach out and make sure that they do for next pieces of work of legislation.
