Headline 1: Bakery Square rezoning plan with new affordable housing moves forward to a public hearing.
Summary 1: - A plan to rezone several parcels of land near Bakery Square is moving forward after a City Council vote. The changes would expand the SP-9/Bakery Square special zoning district.

- The rezoning is linked to a Community Benefits Agreement that includes a program to build 100 affordable homes for purchase in nearby neighborhoods like Larmer. These homes will be for residents earning 80% of the area median income (AMI).

    - 5% of units for residents at or below 50% AMI.
    - 5% of units for residents between 80% and 120% AMI.

- Council voted to approve the updated plan and will now schedule a public hearing for community feedback before taking a final vote.
