"You have an order which, Yes, sir, I can knock the food in about 20 minutes, That's okay- 15.",x

"Mr Brintley, I just want to thank him because when did you start this?",x
So this is now our 27th year of doing this.,x
We've done this every year that I've been on council and it really is a great initiative.,x
"I want to thank Mr Brintley for starting this many, many years ago.",x
I want to thank the school board directors for continuing it And I definitely want to thank all the brothers who have been supportive over the years.,x
"With that, I want to turn it over to Mr Brintley, and then I would also ask the mayor to give remarks.",x
"Yes, sir, Thank you, Mr President, and thank you, members of council.",x
"Once again, we are always excited.",x
"If I can take a quick moment just to tell you, this is a kickoff.",x
We do this 30 days before the actual date.,x
So in May- somebody give me the date.,x
"Is it 17th, 20th, 16th, May 16th is the day where we call Take a Father to School Day.",x
"We ask men across the city to get up, get out, take a personal day, vacation day, whatever, and go into any of the Pittsburgh public schools.",x
They have special activities designed to attract men.,x
"Okay, What I always tell the principals and administrators when I was on the board is: I will get the men in your building, You find a way to keep them, And they've been very, very successful.",x
"Today's date is a day, it's a kickoff, because I think it's important that our children who are watching, that our mothers who are watching and our sisters and our aunts, that they see men, black men, young men, old men, white men- all of us Stand and publically show and say our commitment to children.",x
"Kids are under attack today, okay, But we need to stand and show that we are together.",x
So this is what this day's about.,x
"Secondly, my hat that I'm wearing- and please forgive me because I normally remove it, but I have to represent, two years ago, one of the activities that happened at Martin Luther King School, the principal, under the leadership of Dr Gordon, had a panel where the majority of the men in the audience and we were able to talk And actually the honorable mayor was part of that panel and I was part of the panel.",x
"At the end, as a parting gift, she gave me the hat that said Number One, Dad, and I said Sister, I'm going to represent, So I am here to represent her.",x
But thank you very much.,x
"But first of all we're going to start off with my board director, Mr Dwayne Barker, And Dwayne Barker is going to take a moment to just kind of identify some folks, some of his colleagues, and then we're going to go into a few more things.",x
"Good morning, I'm going to try to go really quick.",x
So we have a couple of organizations that we want to most definitely give it a shout-out to.,x

"and we've got to give a shout-out to our amazing, beautiful aka Sisters.",x
it's over there representing.,x
"Thank you ladies, Thank you ladies.",x

"Thank you, Mr Brentley.",x
"This is a really important season for Pittsburgh Public Schools, with lots of hard work and decisions to be made, but a reminder that men show up When men are called, men show up, And so I'm appreciative of the men- men in this room and the men around this district who, even if they can't show up every day for every parent-teacher conference, we know that they are in the lives of our children and we are integral into for the success.",x
"so, on behalf of the board of directors of Pittsburgh Public Schools, thank you, president Lavelle, thank you, mr Brintley, thank you, mayor Ganey, and best wishes on the rest of the season.",x
"thank you, thank you, mr president, thank you very much and we appreciate all of the in-kind service over the years.",x
"next, remember, this year we're focusing and we're going to continue to follow behind dr Walters, who his focus is on reading and he believes that if you can't read, things can be very difficult.",x
so we constantly are pushing and supporting that and we always have our partners.,x
we have two of our wonderful partners and we have a representative from each and we're asking if they would come to the microphone there and say a few words.,x
"well, representative from RIF, which is reading is fundamental.",x
take a moment please.,x
"my friend Cal, if you can, and then, right with him, is where's our friend from Carnegie Library?",x
"there's, there are hang partners.",x
they here today.,x
"okay, okay, good, Good morning everyone.",x
"First of all, thank you, President and council members, for letting Reading is Fundamental Pittsburgh be a part of this amazing event.",x
"Our mission at RIF is to ensure that all kids in the Pittsburgh community have access to books and resources to motivate them to develop a love of reading, and in the past year we provided almost eighty four thousand books on the north side, the south side, the Hill District.",x
"Fazon, or Pittsburgh Faison, is the school at Homewood that we serve in Hazelwood and in Wilkinsburg, And my work specifically is in our mentoring program Rip- Everybody Wins, where we match volunteers to read for an hour a week with kids at Pittsburgh Faison in Homewood, at Pittsburgh Weill in the Hill District and at Pittsburgh King on the north side, as well as Manchester Academic Charter School.",x
So today I would just like to reiterate the importance of having adults in kids' lives and the power that reading has to let kids learn more about themselves and learn more about the world.,x
We like to say that books provide windows and mirrors for kids.,x
"They can see themselves reflected and their specialness and their importance shown on the page, while also learning about others in our community and in our community.",x
"So if you would be interested in reading for an hour a week with kids in one of our schools, we have over 200 mentors this year.",x
I would love to serve more kids next year.,x
"You can visit our website, riffpittsburghorg slash mentoring or you can come see me or my colleague Corey and we'll give you a card.",x
But thank you for letting us be part of this event and thank you to everyone in this room for what you do to support the kids here in Pittsburgh.,x
"Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.",x
Thank you very much.,x

"But while he's preparing, it is a call and response.",x
There are three sections.,x
"There are three sections individual read and then, of course, we will read the response, but I also want to take a second to tell you what's going to happen when we finish, immediately when this is over, downstairs, outside, set up, set up in the portico, as we have some tables, we have lunches and I believe the t-shirts from not mistaken will be there, okay, and we will also have our friends from a HN.",x
our focus is also men.,x

"miss Gandhi, I know you're running around, if you could just stand and just wave your hand, that's all.",x
"we just want to say thank you, that there's the other.",x
"we just we just want to say thank you, and when you go you will see miss gandy.",x
I think she'll have some tickets.,x
you can get a ticket.,x

"we're gonna be raffling off- I think it's a basket of sporting Pittsburgh's, a signed, signed football from, still from the Steelers.",x
"yes, sir, miss gandhi, put them tickets aside.",x
"all right, we're tough, so make sure that you see her to get your name in here, okay.",x

"In the name of the school, we would like to sincerely thank the City of Pittsburgh for officially declaring April 22: 2025: Take a Father to School Day in the City of Pittsburgh.",x
This declaration is so much more than an allocation of representation for our school district.,x
"It is a reminder that fathers in the City of Pittsburgh, specifically in Pittsburgh Public Schools, do show up and are genuinely committed and invested in the academic achievement of our students.",x
We thank the forefathers who were committed enough to displaying the fact that fathers are actually engaged in their child's lives.,x

"Just one step at a time, And so we appreciate you guys, members of Council, for allowing us to come here.",x

"And just for the folks in this room, I want briefly to acknowledge some mailers that came to many of your mailboxes over the Easter weekend.",x
"Campaigns are campaigns, Politics is politics, So I'm not going to comment on that.",x
"However, the implications that 30 years of purposeful neglect and disinvestment in Black communities is the fault or legacy of our first Black mayor is appalling.",x
Attacking the mayor's wife is appalling.,x
"Saying that contracts that were awarded to two Black women led organizations that went through the legal, fully vetted RFP process were somehow not transparent or somehow sweetheart deals feeds into the anti-black, anti-inclusion and anti-DEI rhetoric that we are seeing all over the country.",x
It's shameful and I am embarrassed and I feel the need to apologize on behalf of our entire city government.,x
"to be quite frank, But I do wanna say that, given this room, all of you, you all worked so hard, you all worked so hard for the betterment of your communities and I want you to know that Pittsburgh sees that, Despite of what's in the media, despite of nasty mailers like this.",x
there are so many people around this city.,x

"thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you for our chair, But I gotta tell you, councilwoman, as young folks would say, I felt that Thank you.",x
All.,x
"right, we're gonna hold just our fist ball in here to show our determination for educating our children and volunteering, and we're just gonna say our cheer.",x
"When I say Pittsburgh, you say fathers, And each time you go louder, we do it three times: Pittsburgh Fathers, Pittsburgh Fathers, Pittsburgh Fathers.",x
"Thank you, members of council, Thank you, Thank you.",x
Can you guys get in closer together?,x
"Come up, you can come to the front here.",x
"I'm short, I'm gonna get everybody into.",x
"No, I'm gonna take over.",x
"hey, councilwoman, come with me.",x

Can I have everyone from Fair Housing up for Fair Housing Month?,x
Appreciate it?,x
"We have so much good work and so many important issues in front of Council all at the same time, especially in this time, I think, nationally, where we are kind of feeling, I think, our responsibility as local governments to doing what we, as our jurisdiction, and our responsibility to do in the jurisdictions that we represent.",x
"So I'm going to this is one that we give annually, but it's really important to remind us of the importance of these issues as we work through them.",x
"Whereas April 11th 2025 marks the 57th anniversary of the passage of the US Fair Housing Act, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which, as amended, pronounces a national policy mandating fair housing opportunities for all citizens, regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability or familial status, And whereas on December 16th 1958, Mayor David Lawrence signed the Fair Housing Practices Ordinance into effect which, as amended, additionally prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of ancestry, gender identity, gender expression, place of birth, sexual orientation, status as a survivor and the right to housing.",x
And so we're going to be doing that.,x
"Thank you, DENISE GASH.",x
IEE L OFisticayıt.,x
"I can make one suggestion, And I think Hillary and I, chorus, are going to be saying this: but the community should be swaying in favor of fair housing, roz-ezingist TZT and ability to access access, whether it be custody, orøre years and the pract Czech language, Because we are all human beings And and we don't want criminal export or career hunting or slavery, and ending housing inequity for its citizens.",x
"Whereas the international community, in 2022 and 2023, issued recommendations to public officials in the US calling for improved efforts to address systemic discrimination that perpetuates poverty and homelessness and disproportionately harms racialized and other vulnerable populations.",x
"Whereas the city, through its mayor and council, reaffirmed the commitment to ensuring housing as a human right through its policy, implementation and enforcement.",x

May we have a motion So moved.,x
Is there a second Second?,x
"All those in favor say aye, Aye, Aye, Congratulations.",x
"Thank you, Appreciate it.",x
I will turn it over to our leaders.,x
"Thank you, Appreciate it.",x
And there's the information.,x
"Good morning, We are still morning.",x
"Yes, Thank you all for hanging out.",x
We really appreciate the opportunity to come before council every year and commemorate fair housing month.,x
"It is more important than ever, considering the state of fair housing across the country.",x
"We don't take for granted that we as a commission are still in good standing and able to do the work that we do every day, because you all put your faith in us to do that.",x
So thank you.,x
And with me today I have our commission staff.,x
"I want to thank them as well, because they come to the table every day ready to fight for fair housing.",x
"They it's not just a month, It's not just a day, It's every day with my staff.",x
So I just thank you for the work that you do.,x
Housing is a human right.,x
"We hear that a lot these days, but what do we mean when we say that?",x
What comes after the slogan?,x
"Yes, stable housing is the most important prerequisite for us to thrive and build a decent life.",x
"But deeper than that, housing is one of our most basic survival needs.",x
"The things that we all need to survive aren't conveniences, They aren't gifts, They're essentials.",x
Controlling access to housing is a powerful tool to keep people away from opportunity.,x
"Mayor David Lawrence understood this When, in 1958, he signed the Fair Housing Practices Ordinance for the city of Pittsburgh and entrusted the Human Relations Commission with enforcing those practices.",x
"President Johnson understood this 10 years later when he signed the Civil Rights Act of 1968, And this is still understood today by those in Washington, in Harrisburg and here in the city who want to frustrate the city and overcome the AKD, the mission of fair housing advocates, and end equal access to housing.",x
President Johnson's signature on the Fair Housing Act capped a decade of work from Dr Martin Luther King Jr.,x
It was signed into law one week after Dr King's death and the demonstrations ensued.,x
"We should be reminded of the high price paid for equality and fairness in housing And in a way, we are reminded of that now.",x
Today we stand against efforts unseen for decades to attack and undermine basic fair housing rights.,x
"We choose to stand with those who came before, who fought, suffered and, yes, died to establish the right of fair housing, regardless of race, religion, sex, sexual orientation or any other circumstance that is beyond their control.",x
"Today is a reminder of our commitment, And so I thank City Council and Mayor Ganey for your dedication, for your recognition and for having us here today.",x
"Thank you, Yeah, so we've got with us today our Deputy Director, Christopher Solt, a Senior Investigator, Lauren Law, Senior Investigator David Elwood and Senior Investigator Rita Porterfield- Absolutely All members.",x
"Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.",x
I think we're going to be taking questions.,x
We hope you have your questions raised.,x
We will move on to the next item of questions.,x
"Thank you, Mrs Johnson.",x
"G restored police officer for visual as a model to understandable, letting us talk about gameplay in which we have no general consideration from the level of individual knowledge that they can give from a community perspective.",x
"So just some closing thoughts and last but certainly not least, councilman mosley, oh yeah, can mr cooper and and your guests can come up as well.",x
this proclamation is a real treat.,x
"you know, i grew up, you know, hearing many stories about the great chuck cooper in my household.",x
my father served in the navy in california with mr cooper as well as played a lot of basketball with mr cooper when they both came back to pittsburgh and i was at pittsburgh when mr cooper went to attend duquesne university and my father was at the university of pittsburgh and obviously mr cooper had the best team.,x
i think he played for the center avenue wide.,x
my dad played for the collegians.,x
this was back in in the in the early 50s.,x
"so when me and and mr cooper got to meet about about two years ago, it was really a treat because it was almost like we grew up together, even though we had never met, because my father shared so many stories, and thank you so much for setting up the interview and for being here and for being here and for being here and for being here.",x
i'm actually pretty proud of the fact that we could have an interview with the national basketball association when they came to town a few months ago and allowed my father to share his personal stories of the time that he spent with mr cooper and then allowed me to talk about the kind of historical significance of of mr cooper and what he means to the city of pittsburgh.,x
"what he needs means the game of basketball, and i look at this as today is really the beginning of a year-long celebration to the great milestone that began 75 years ago on friday.",x
"so Whereas Charles Henry Cooper, born September 29th 1926 to Daniel and Emma Cooper in Pittsburgh, PA Charles, affectionately known as Chuck, was a proud graduate of Westinghouse High School class of 1944, After graduation Chuck briefly played a semester of college basketball at West Virginia State College, now University, before his service in the US Navy during World War II, And whereas after serving in the US Navy, Mr Cooper enrolled at Duquesne University where he started all four years and set the school record for total points of 990 points in one season Mr Cooper's team had a 78-19 record and was invited to the then prestigious National Invitational Tournament twice.",x
"And whereas on April 25th 1950, Mr Cooper became the first African American ever drafted into the National Basketball Association and was drafted by the Boston Celtics.",x
"He was the first African American to be drafted into the National Basketball Association, led by owner Walter Brown and coached by the legendary Red Auerbach, and was the teammate of the great Bob Cousy, among many others, Mr Cooper played a total of 409 NBA games, scoring 2,725 points, 2,431 rebounds and 733 assists.",x
"And very recently, and long overdue, Mr Cooper was enshrined in the National Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts.",x
"Now, in his assessment of his current career, Mr Cooper- careless of course because he was thinking about the World Cup in principio- was finally summoned to the plötzlich and shocking surging ihn.",x
"in the Dd of 1995, Nielsen These victory mentioned a punchline to indicate who he was and why.",x
Peter King peace Speaker.,x
the facts: It was unclear and most honest in history for Mr Cooper'setta.,x
junto.,x
"beautiful city, Pittsburgh has hereby respect and isn't recognized and congratulate Charles Chuck Cooper for his commitment to community, serving his country, shattering racial barriers as well as barriers here in the City of Pittsburgh Is after his basketball career.",x
"after a basketball career, he worked in the banking industry, locally as an executive and was theınd game department head.",x
"so again, you know his trailblazing.",x
history goes far beyond the hard court into the halls of corporate america as well as city government.,x
"so be it further resolved that the council of the city of pittsburgh does hereby declare friday, april 25th 2025 to be charles chuck cooper day in the city of pittsburgh.",x
may we have a motion so move second.,x
"all those in favor say aye, aye, congratulations.",x
thank you so much.,x
you know to have a day recognized and my father honor is just a tremendous accomplishment.,x
"and i just can't thank councilman mosley enough for not only his, his great work and leadership in the city of pittsburgh, but he's a big supporter of the chuck cooper foundation and council president lavelle, we have a history as well.",x
"the house that i grew up in was purchased by, was purchased from the vale real estate, his family's business back in the day.",x
"so i heard, heard his name a lot, my household and it ended up being connected to this council body.",x
it was back in 1970 when my father became the first black city department director.,x
it needed approval of city council.,x
so i feel connected to each and every one of you and thank you for your hard work.,x
public officials don't get as much credit as you deserve for what you put in.,x
it's a sacrifice to not only you but the people who are involved in the city of pittsburgh and the city of pittsburgh and the city of puerto rico.,x
"so i want to thank you, you for your hard work and dedication.",x
"it was 1950, april 25th, in a smoke field room in in chicago, illinois, it was boston turn the pick.",x
"it was in the second round but it was the 13th overall pick and walter brown, the owner of celtics, stood up and said boston takes chuck cooper, the all-american, out of duquesne university.",x
"and when the owner said you can't take him, he's colored- i think he used a different word, but at least that's how i was reported today.",x
and walter brown was the first black city department executive of the city council in the city of puerto rico and he was a real affluent man.,x
he was the first black city department and he was the first black city department and he was the first black mayor of puerto rico and he was a former mayor of puerto rico and he was the first black.,x
"And Walter Brown said: I don't give a damn If he's straight, poke it out or play it, Boston takes Chuck Cooper And the rest was history.",x
"And he went on and had a great rookie season with the Boston Celtics, made the all-rookie team, was in contention for rookie of the year and really enjoyed his time in Boston, Came back to Pittsburgh, like Councilman Moseley said, continued to break barriers in city government and also at Pittsburgh National Bank.",x
But back in those days it wasn't easy.,x
He actually only stayed in his department as director of Parks and Recreation for a little over a year.,x
That was reported in Pittsburgh paper.,x
They asked him why he resigned.,x
"He said: listen, I've been the first on a few occasions, but never once have I been a token and I won't start now.",x
"But one thing he did accomplish was he had East Hills Park, which is probably one of the most beautiful community parks, finished and built up in East Hills.",x
"So he was very proud of that, because the kids up there didn't have anywhere to play.",x
"So I'm really honored to be able to get, And I'm really honored to be able to continue to push his legacy forward through the work of the Chuck Cooper Foundation.",x
I started that organization back in 2013.,x
"Since then we've awarded 400,000 in scholarships and we outreach to thousands of kids to our Beacons of Light outreach program.",x
"That, too, has been a sacrifice.",x
"I thank my beautiful, lovely wife, Shelly Cooper, for being here.",x
I'll never forget.,x
I got laid off in the pharmaceutical industry.,x
She said: what are you going to do now?,x
Are you going to go to a competitor?,x
"I said no, I think I'm going to start a company.",x
"I said, no, I think I'm going to start a company, But I think I've got a foundation from scratch.",x
"So I don't know how we made it, but we got through.",x
"But again, it truly is an honor and a pleasure to be here and to be able to work with young people.",x
"elevate my father's name, And just a couple of quick things that you might not be aware of.",x
"As Constable Mosley said, he got inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2019.",x
"Right now, at Duquesne University, there's actually two buildings on campus named in his honor: UPMC Cooper Fieldhouse.",x
"that you might have heard about, But if you go to the Mary Lemieux statue, caddy corner is the Chuck Cooper building.",x
"and and also, if you're in the NBA or you're in a Western Conference and you win the Pacific Division Championship, you get a beautiful Chuck Cooper trophy.",x
"so I couldn't have done it without some tremendous professionals who helped me grow and develop the Chuck Cooper foundation: people like Tom Rooney, Zach Thomas, Matt Mead, Bob Durda- I could go on and on, but I couldn't do it without their tremendous support.",x
"a law firm, Buchanan, Eggersom, Rooney were tremendous supporters, but I can go on and on, but we get tremendous amount of corporate support.",x
"I got a shout out: UPMC and UPMC, health plan, Highmark and many others, so just I really want to thank you again for this incredible recognition and wish you all the best.",x
thank you so much.,x
I got a couple jerseys.,x
if we could bring them up for a photo out?,x
"yeah, absolutely, yeah, all right, I'd love to take a picture with a Chuck, okay, yeah, members could come up as well.",x
I would love to have them come up.,x
anybody with this guy?,x
"a couple jerseys, oh my god, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, thank you, thank you, I appreciate it.",x
"yeah, mm-hmm, okay, yeah, I love that.",x
"okay, that's it.",x
"yes, cool, thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.",x
"Oh, thank you, Thank you.",x
"My rights have been violated seriously And I'm asking the government to step up, and what I mean by that.",x
"I don't expect you to do nothing for me legally, but I expect you to get me to the right particular department or section that will not have this stuff.",x
continue to go on.,x
"Okay, My right, the rights that have been violated, is my protected right of the workers' compensation act, Okay.",x
"Okay, at the age of 58.",x
"okay, I did everything right, but the company ignored me and fired me illegally.",x
"Okay, they've been trying to cover it up with some systemic, structural, corrupted process And I'm here to actually fight against it.",x
I'm going to continue to fight against it.,x
The fact of the matter is that another right that has been violated is my ADA right and my ADEA right.,x
"Okay, Title 18 has been violated, Section 241, 242.",x
It's a criminal.,x
It's criminal.,x
I've been trying to file a criminal complaint with this and everybody's been ignoring me.,x
"Just like the lady said, there's people who died for our rights.",x
"okay, and it needs to be taken care of.",x
"Okay, I'm here.",x
"I would like to speak with- eventually, after this is over, with Councilman Mosley, because what happened is Joshua Pero has established commissions.",x
"okay, so that our voices can be heard, I need to speak with Joshua Pero.",x
This is ridiculous.,x
The attorneys that represented me housed a conflict of interest.,x
The attorney that represented me works for an insurance company.,x
He did not disclose that information to me.,x
He has a mentality to save as much money as possible in his standard of care.,x
He has a mentality to save as much money as possible in his standard of care And he's not going to give me a chance to speak to him.,x
So I'm going to give him time.,x
I'm going to give him time.,x
So I'm going to give him time.,x
I'm going to give him time.,x
"I don't have all of my evidence presented today, because I figured I was only going to get three minutes.",x
"I don't have all of my evidence presented today, because I figured I was only going to get three minutes.",x
"So I just come here to speak with you And, like I said before I leave, I'd like to speak with Councilmember Mosley in order to get, so he can tell me how I can further get ahold of Joshua Pero or any of my state representatives.",x
"Thank you, Thank you very much.",x
That exhausts our listening audience.,x
"Thank you, Thank you.",x
That exhausts our list of registered speakers.,x
"If there's anyone in chambers wishing to speak, please come forward at this time.",x
"Also, provide your name and neighborhood for the record.",x
"Hi, I'm Bernadette from Beachview.",x
I saw those flyers that came out and I was disgusted with it.,x
"I did the research a couple weeks ago and the backers of Cory O'Connor, as I had stated before, spend a lot too much time in and out of court.",x
I also researched the developers that have backed Mayor Ganey.,x
"The typical docket entries are no lien agreements, which is very common.",x
"if you're a contractor, That's what you expect.",x
Nothing that would jump out at anybody going through the dockets.,x
"Now these attacks- yes, attacks on people who Mayor Ganey may know, or his wife may know, or females, or anything of that nature- kudos.",x
"to him That means he's hiring, or he knows, reputable people that don't spend all their time in dockets.",x
And then you have the docket line at the county.,x
There's a big difference.,x
So what if it's all women?,x
So what if they're friends of the mayor that are reputable and do good work and don't spend all their time in the docket entry line at the prothonotary's office?,x
The mayor has done great things in this city.,x
I look forward to this next debate.,x
It seems like we're no longer Democratic and Republican.,x
"Now there's a third party in there- Trumpsters, And it's just a level that is disgusting, And still to this day.",x
"after I was called a nimby because a lot of Corey's backers are underappreciated, I called him under Sequoiare, which is a defined definition of NIMBY and that indicates nameless people.",x
I had to turn to Mrs May about this.,x
reduces stuff after ladyB0a Energizer to have no plan out who's going to be the mayor.,x
"I had to turn to Mrs May Olson, who takes the lead in this, for having a clean, reputable, not a name calling, not throwing things at each other, just a standout man, thank you.",x
Thank you very much.,x
"next speaker, please?",x
My name is Yvonne F Burns and I live at 715 Mercer Street up in the Hill District.,x
"I wanted to address you, Ms Hardwick.",x
"You brought out about, I think, a picture like this for the housing supposed to be that Mayor Ganey is not taking care of the community like he should.",x
I came down because I saw a picture of where they have Mayor Ganey as black as coal and they're saying about supposed to be money from the affordable housing.,x
"but I thought when to do, though?",x
"even when Luke left, there was questions about that money.",x
"Money was being was missing then, And then, when they changed mayorship, there was actually trucks that were stolen.",x
They disappeared.,x
You didn't hear nothing about that.,x
"but now you all, you're all trying to blame it on Ganey.",x
"I don't care for Ganey, but the truth is this: If you're gonna tell the truth, that's what you do.",x
Don't make it like he's such a sinister man.,x
They made him real black.,x
that's supposed to be?,x
Put fear in you when you're black fear.,x
That's what they did with his picture.,x
I know what they're doing.,x
I've seen it.,x
I went to college.,x
I studied psychology.,x
"I may get up here and you may think that I don't know, but I do know a lot.",x
I went to college.,x
Anytime they had something that was a free class I went to.,x
I wanna know.,x
I wanna know what's happening in the world.,x
I want to be treated the same as everybody else.,x
I wanna make sure that I get what you get.,x
"My children, my grandchildren get the same.",x
I have lived.,x
in July I will be 79 years old.,x
I have lived a long time.,x
I have come down here over 20 something years.,x
"I have watched things, I have learned things.",x
I have learned.,x
I have seen things.,x
I have seen your ways.,x
I have seen you while I'm talking and anybody else.,x
you're talking amongst yourself.,x
"You're on the phone, You're on the computer.",x
The young white girl: when she came up she was a little the same as I am.,x
She came up and she said I wasn't gonna speak.,x
She said: but I watched you And she was angry.,x
"She said: these people come down to speak and you're on your phone, you're on your computers, you're on this, you're on that.",x
Do you understand that?,x
"this woman, this young child- I can't say young child, She's about 17 or 18- But she knows what our civil duty is.",x
Our civil duty is to tell you what we need.,x
You can't know if you don't live in my neighborhood.,x
"You can't know that we don't have transportation to get down to the bottom of the hill, to the hospital.",x
"But when we have a meeting about the police, Ms Gross and the president will make the decision that we have to go to Lawrenceville two buses to be able to speak what we want to say.",x
"But we can take one bus to go right down here, But to speak we gotta come to her neighborhood.",x
Thank you very much.,x
Forgive me.,x
forgive me to do better.,x
Thank you very much.,x
"Thank you, Ms Brown.",x
"Next speaker, please.",x
"Good morning, David Tessitore Banksville.",x
"35 years ago to this morning, an event kicked off at Point State Park with Native American ceremony at daybreak.",x
"By the end of the day, we were told 75,000 people had come to the 20th anniversary of Earth Day.",x
"And this being Earth Day, I made sure I came to speak.",x
In the years I should point out that I was one of the organizers.,x
There were 60 members of the coalition.,x
My organization that I was the executive director of at the time was in charge of all the children's programming.,x

"In the years since then I have fought most of my time trying to challenge the primary threat to both the city and the natural environment, and that is real estate speculation.",x
"A few years after that we were told that southwestern Pennsylvania had the third highest rate of land consumption in the country, with a continuing decline of population, And that was from suburban sprawl.",x
The number one existential threat to this city is real estate speculation.,x
"Now we've had comment about the mayoral race and the funding being by a lot of real estate speculators, but it goes back a long ways, back to the 1980s when the airport area was designated to be the new central business district.",x
Want to know why the city has been going down?,x
Because many of your predecessors and maybe some of yourselves have made decisions which have enabled that to happen And it's continuing.,x
"Evidently they aren't quite satisfied, so they're dumping lots of money into this mayoral race.",x
"But we have seen This city is the furthest away from its airport, I think, of any of the major cities And I think of the major metropolitan areas, we're the only one not connected by rail, And yet that's supposed to be the new downtown.",x
"So what we have seen happen- I saw it back in the 80s when Volkwines moved out- I said, ah, I see what's happening.",x
"So I do hope, and I hope, to come before you to address more on this issue.",x
but real estate speculation- and the voters will have a chance to speak about that themselves- is the number one existential threat to this city.,x
