Headline 1: Council approves ordinance to increase paid sick leave accrual rates and maximum hours
Summary 1: - The City Council approved an ordinance amending the Paid Sick Days Act to increase the rate at which employees accrue paid sick leave and raise the maximum hours they can accumulate.  
- Employees of employers with 15 or more workers will now accrue 1 hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked, with a maximum of 72 hours per year (up from previous limits).  
- Employees of employers with fewer than 15 workers will also accrue 1 hour per 30 hours worked, with a maximum of 48 hours per year.  
- Accrued sick time can be carried over year to year unless the employer provides the full amount at the start of the calendar year.  
- The ordinance includes provisions for reinstating sick time if rehired within six months and allows employers to loan sick time in advance.  
- These changes take effect on January 1, 2026.  
- The legislation was sponsored by Council President Lavelle and referred to the Committee on Finance and Law before approval.

Headline 2: Council holds resolution to fund non-congregate shelter services with Auberle for five weeks
Summary 2: - The City Council voted to hold Resolution 2024-0749 for five weeks, delaying authorization for the Mayor and Budget Director to enter into a $1.5 million agreement with Auberle for non-congregate shelter services under the HOME-ARP program.  
- The delay is to allow time for the administration to address issues related to the project, including a new application process triggered by miscommunication between government entities.  
- HUD is reviewing a substantial amendment to the HOME-ARP plan, which includes public notices and meetings, with a consultant meeting scheduled to plan next steps.  
- Councilmembers expressed frustration over the long delay since July 2024 and the federal rules that classify shared bathroom facilities as congregate, limiting the use of tiny houses for shelter despite their potential for quick, low-cost housing.  
- The $1.5 million funding is intended for non-congregate shelter services but faces challenges due to federal definitions and coordination among agencies.  
- Councilmembers encouraged constituents to contact administration staff, including Kelly Russell, for updates during the hold period.

- The grant money will be deposited into the City's Grants Trust Fund and managed through regular procurement processes.  
- The resolution passed with an affirmative recommendation from the Public Safety and Wellness Committee.
