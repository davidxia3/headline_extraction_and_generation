Headline 2: $37,000 grant approved for old sexual assault case investigations.
Summary 2: - City Council unanimously approved a resolution to accept a $37,000 grant from Allegheny County.
- The grant is part of the 2023 National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, a program aimed at helping law enforcement investigate cold cases.
- The funds will be used by the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police (PBP) for three specific purposes:
    - To pay for overtime for detectives investigating old sexual assault cases.
    - To purchase materials to furnish a "soft interview room," creating a more comfortable and supportive environment for victims.
    - To allow police to participate in approved training opportunities related to these investigations.
- The measure passed with a 9-0 vote and without any discussion among council members.

Headline 3: Council hears conflicting public testimony on a bill to reduce minimum lot sizes for homes.
Summary 3: - The City Council held a public hearing for Bill 1579, which proposes reducing the minimum lot size required to build a home and removing the minimum lot size required per housing unit.

- The bill, sponsored by Councilmembers Wilson, Warwick, and Charland, is based on a recommendation from the 2022 Housing Needs Assessment to help address the city's housing shortage and affordability challenges.

- City Planning staff explained that a large number of existing city lots are smaller than current rules allow, making it difficult to build new homes or even rebuild existing ones. The proposed changes include:
    - **Very-Low Density:** 8,000 sq. ft. reduced to 6,000 sq. ft.
    - **Low-Density:** 5,000 sq. ft. reduced to 3,000 sq. ft.
    - **Moderate-Density:** 3,200 sq. ft. reduced to 2,400 sq. ft.
    - **High-Density:** 1,800 sq. ft. reduced to 1,200 sq. ft.
    - **Very-High Density:** 1,200 sq. ft. minimum requirement removed entirely.

- Many members of the public spoke in favor of the bill, stating that current rules make much of the city's historic housing illegal to rebuild. They argued the changes would allow for more housing to be built on vacant lots, increase supply, and "re-legalize" homes that fit neighborhood character.

- A second group supported the idea but opposed passing it separately from a larger package of zoning reforms. They argued that this "piecemeal" approach would pass developer-friendly changes while leaving behind more critical affordability measures like inclusionary zoning.

- A third group of speakers opposed the bill entirely, arguing it would lead to overcrowding, harm neighborhood quality of life, and benefit "predatory landlords" without creating truly affordable housing.
