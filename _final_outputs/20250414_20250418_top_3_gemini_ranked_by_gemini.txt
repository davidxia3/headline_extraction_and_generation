Headline 1: City Council places a five-week hold on a $1.5 million contract with Auberle for shelter services.
Summary 1: - City Council voted to delay a decision on a $1.5 million contract with the nonprofit Auberle for five weeks.
- The contract would use federal HOME-ARP funds to provide non-congregate, or individual, shelter services.
- The delay is needed to resolve a "lack of communication" between city and county officials, who had conflicting plans for who would be housed in the proposed shelter.
- A new approval process must now take place, which will include a public meeting and a 15-day comment period.
- Councilmembers noted that while they had previously hoped the funds could be used for a tiny house community, federal rules for this funding source make that difficult.
