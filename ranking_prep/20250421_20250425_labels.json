including the Four Mile Run project that has been in development for six years\n\n\u2022 The paused projects are Four Mile Run, Stewart Avenue, MLK Field, and South Side Park - with Four Mile Run being the most critical due to severe flooding that fills the neighborhood with sewage when heavy rains occur\n\n\u2022 Pittsburgh Water has spent $8.7 million on the Four Mile Run project design, which is now 90% complete, but needs an additional $30 million for construction\n\n\u2022 The project lost $10 million in funding from Alcasan when green infrastructure elements (stream daylighting) were removed due to permitting challenges with the state and CSX railroad\n\n\u2022 Pittsburgh Water's $1.2 billion capital improvement plan over five years prioritizes mandated projects like the Water Reliability Plan (30% of funding) and lead service line replacement over stormwater projects\n\n\u2022 Recent improvements to the M-29 outfall may have helped reduce flooding, but Pittsburgh Water is conducting hydraulic modeling to confirm the impact since no major storms have occurred since 2021\n\n\u2022 Army Corps of Engineers representatives outlined potential federal funding programs that could provide 75% reimbursement for flood mitigation work if Pittsburgh Water applies\n\n\u2022 Council Member Warwick expressed frustration that residents who fought against the Mon

The funding was withdrawn after green infrastructure elements were removed from the plan due to technical issues, meaning the project no longer met Alcosan\u2019s requirements.\n- PWSA is now studying whether other recent sewer work in the Four Mile Run area has already helped reduce flooding.\n- The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers stated that PWSA could apply for federal programs that may cover up to 75% of project costs.": "G0", "- Pittsburgh Water has paused four major flood mitigation projects, including the Four Mile Run project, primarily due to funding challenges and increased construction costs.\n- The Four Mile Run project is at 90% design but lost $10 million in funding after green infrastructure elements were removed, reducing its combined sewer overflow (CSO) reduction benefits below the funding threshold.\n- Total project costs are estimated at $40 million, with about $8.7 million already spent on planning and design; construction alone is expected to cost around $30 million.\n- Funding priorities have shifted toward mandated projects like the $470 million Water Reliability Plan, which addresses critical drinking water infrastructure and is court-ordered.\n- Technical and permitting issues, including disagreements over stream lining and railroad right-of-way constraints, also complicated the Four Mile Run project.\n- Pittsburgh Water continues to maintain existing infrastructure and respond to flooding complaints despite the project pause.\n- The Army Corps of Engineers highlighted potential federal funding programs that could support future stormwater projects if Pittsburgh Water pursues partnerships.\n- Councilmembers expressed concern over the impact on residents, especially in Four Mile Run, where flooding and sewage backups remain serious problems.\n- Pittsburgh Water plans to complete design work and conduct hydraulic evaluations to assess recent improvements, such as the M-29 outfall reconstruction.\n- Community engagement and transparent communication are planned before any future public meetings on the project\u2019s status and next steps.": "O0", "\u2022 Council introduced a resolution allowing Team Pittsburgh Ball Hockey to live-stream dek hockey games at Marmaduke Park's rink at no cost to the city\n\n\u2022 The agreement would involve LiveBarn, a sports streaming network that broadcasts amateur and youth sports using their equipment and software\n\n\u2022 The dek hockey rink is located at Marmaduke Park on 3915 Oswald Street\n\n\u2022 Council waived normal rules to fast-track the resolution to tomorrow's committee meeting\n\n\u2022 The Mayor and Director of Public Works would be authorized to sign agreements with LiveBarn and/or Team Pittsburgh for the streaming service\n\n\u2022 Any agreements must be approved by the City Solicitor for proper legal form": "C1", "- City Council introduced legislation that would allow Team Pittsburgh Ball Hockey to live-stream games from the dek hockey rink in Marmaduke Park.\n- The streaming would be done through a partnership with LiveBarn, a company that specializes in broadcasting youth and amateur sports.\n- Under the proposed agreement, the streaming service would be provided at no cost to the City.\n- Council fast-tracked the bill so it could be reviewed by the Committee on Innovation, Performance, Asset Management, and Technology the following day.\n- If approved, the legislation authorizes the Mayor and the Director of Public Works to enter into a formal agreement for the service.": "G1", "- The City Council authorized the Mayor and the Director of Public Works to enter into agreements with LiveBarn and Team Pittsburgh Ball Hockey.  \n- These agreements will allow Team Pittsburgh to live-stream dek hockey games at the Dek Hockey Rink in Marmaduke Park.  \n- The live-streaming service will be provided at no cost to the City.  \n- The resolution was introduced by Councilwoman Deborah L.

agreement allowing the University of Pittsburgh to pay for up to 15 additional trash pickups in Oakland during busy periods like student move-in, move-out, and holiday breaks.\n\n\u2022 The university will cover all city costs for the extra collections, including labor, equipment, recycling, and landfill fees \u2014 at no cost to the city.\n\n\u2022 Council amended the original proposal to change from a fixed $3,000 per pickup to actual costs incurred, providing flexibility as landfill and recycling costs fluctuate.\n\n\u2022 The program addresses Oakland's periodic waste problems when university students generate significantly more trash than normal.\n\n\u2022 Previous efforts by the university using private contractors created confusion and were less effective than expected.\n\n\u2022 Past attempts to place dumpsters on streets during move-in periods failed due to abuse, with non-residents filling them before students could use them.\n\n\u2022 Public Works Director Chris Hornstein said the biggest trash volumes occur when students move back in the fall, and the city will be ready for that period.\n\n\u2022 The agreement allows the city's waste collection system to handle the increased volume more effectively than private contractors while ensuring the university pays the full cost.", "G26": "- The University of Pittsburgh will pay for the city to conduct up to 15 extra trash collections in the Oakland neighborhood.\n- These supplemental pickups will happen as needed, with a focus on times when trash piles up, like during student move-in and move-out periods.\n- The university will pay the city for its \"actual costs incurred\" for the extra work, covering labor, equipment, and disposal fees.\n- This arrangement was created because past efforts by the university to hire a private company for the same job were considered confusing and not very effective.\n- City officials noted that an earlier attempt to place large dumpsters on the street during move-out was unsuccessful because they were misused by people from outside the neighborhood.", "O26": "- The City Council approved an amended resolution allowing the Mayor and Public Works Director to enter into an agreement with the University of Pittsburgh for supplemental waste collection in the Oakland neighborhood at no cost to the city.  \n- The University will fund up to 15 additional waste pickups annually, mainly during high-trash periods like student move-in and move-out.  \n- The amendment changed the payment from a fixed $3,000 per event to covering actual costs incurred, allowing flexibility due to fluctuating recycling and landfill fees.  \n- The University had previously tried managing waste pickups with a private vendor, but it was less effective and caused confusion.  \n- Public Works will now handle the supplemental pickups, with costs reimbursed by the University to cover labor, equipment, and disposal fees.  \n-
