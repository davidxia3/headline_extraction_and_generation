Can I have everyone from Fair Housing up for Fair Housing Month? Appreciate it? We have so much good work and so many important issues in front of Council all at the same time, especially in this time, I think, nationally, where we are kind of feeling, I think, our responsibility as local governments to doing what we, as our jurisdiction, and our responsibility to do in the jurisdictions that we represent. So I'm going to this is one that we give annually, but it's really important to remind us of the importance of these issues as we work through them. Whereas April 11th 2025 marks the 57th anniversary of the passage of the US Fair Housing Act, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which, as amended, pronounces a national policy mandating fair housing opportunities for all citizens, regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability or familial status, And whereas on December 16th 1958, Mayor David Lawrence signed the Fair Housing Practices Ordinance into effect which, as amended, additionally prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of ancestry, gender identity, gender expression, place of birth, sexual orientation, status as a survivor and the right to housing. And so we're going to be doing that. Thank you, DENISE GASH. IEE L OFisticayıt. I can make one suggestion, And I think Hillary and I, chorus, are going to be saying this: but the community should be swaying in favor of fair housing, roz-ezingist TZT and ability to access access, whether it be custody, orøre years and the pract Czech language, Because we are all human beings And and we don't want criminal export or career hunting or slavery, and ending housing inequity for its citizens. Whereas the international community, in 2022 and 2023, issued recommendations to public officials in the US calling for improved efforts to address systemic discrimination that perpetuates poverty and homelessness and disproportionately harms racialized and other vulnerable populations. Whereas the city, through its mayor and council, reaffirmed the commitment to ensuring housing as a human right through its policy, implementation and enforcement. Now, therefore, be it resolved that the council of the city of Pittsburgh encourages all agencies, institutions and individuals, public and private, in the city of Pittsburgh, to abide by the letter and the spirit of the fair housing law in pursuit of expanding opportunities and improving the quality of life for all. Be it further resolved that the council of the city of Pittsburgh commits to make every effort to support the citizens of Pittsburgh and the departments, boards, offices and authorities of the city of Pittsburgh in their fight to end discrimination in housing and, affirmatively, further fair housing. Be it further resolved that the council of the city of Pittsburgh does hereby proclaim April 2025 as fair housing month in the city of Pittsburgh. May we have a motion So moved. Is there a second Second? All those in favor say aye, Aye, Aye, Congratulations. Thank you, Appreciate it. I will turn it over to our leaders. Thank you, Appreciate it. And there's the information. Good morning, We are still morning. Yes, Thank you all for hanging out. We really appreciate the opportunity to come before council every year and commemorate fair housing month. It is more important than ever, considering the state of fair housing across the country. We don't take for granted that we as a commission are still in good standing and able to do the work that we do every day, because you all put your faith in us to do that. So thank you. And with me today I have our commission staff. I want to thank them as well, because they come to the table every day ready to fight for fair housing. They it's not just a month, It's not just a day, It's every day with my staff. So I just thank you for the work that you do. Housing is a human right. We hear that a lot these days, but what do we mean when we say that? What comes after the slogan? Yes, stable housing is the most important prerequisite for us to thrive and build a decent life. But deeper than that, housing is one of our most basic survival needs. The things that we all need to survive aren't conveniences, They aren't gifts, They're essentials. Controlling access to housing is a powerful tool to keep people away from opportunity. Mayor David Lawrence understood this When, in 1958, he signed the Fair Housing Practices Ordinance for the city of Pittsburgh and entrusted the Human Relations Commission with enforcing those practices. President Johnson understood this 10 years later when he signed the Civil Rights Act of 1968, And this is still understood today by those in Washington, in Harrisburg and here in the city who want to frustrate the city and overcome the AKD, the mission of fair housing advocates, and end equal access to housing. President Johnson's signature on the Fair Housing Act capped a decade of work from Dr Martin Luther King Jr. It was signed into law one week after Dr King's death and the demonstrations ensued. We should be reminded of the high price paid for equality and fairness in housing And in a way, we are reminded of that now. Today we stand against efforts unseen for decades to attack and undermine basic fair housing rights. We choose to stand with those who came before, who fought, suffered and, yes, died to establish the right of fair housing, regardless of race, religion, sex, sexual orientation or any other circumstance that is beyond their control. Today is a reminder of our commitment, And so I thank City Council and Mayor Ganey for your dedication, for your recognition and for having us here today. Thank you, Yeah, so we've got with us today our Deputy Director, Christopher Solt, a Senior Investigator, Lauren Law, Senior Investigator David Elwood and Senior Investigator Rita Porterfield- Absolutely All members. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. I think we're going to be taking questions. We hope you have your questions raised. We will move on to the next item of questions. Thank you, Mrs Johnson. G restored police officer for visual as a model to understandable, letting us talk about gameplay in which we have no general consideration from the level of individual knowledge that they can give from a community perspective.

Whereas April 11th 2025 marks the 57th anniversary of the passage of the US Fair Housing Act, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which, as amended, pronounces a national policy mandating fair housing opportunities for all citizens, regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability or familial status, And whereas on December 16th 1958, Mayor David Lawrence signed the Fair Housing Practices Ordinance into effect which, as amended, additionally prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of ancestry, gender identity, gender expression, place of birth, sexual orientation, status as a survivor and the right to housing. And so we're going to be doing that. Thank you, DENISE GASH. IEE L OFisticayıt. I can make one suggestion, And I think Hillary and I, chorus, are going to be saying this: but the community should be swaying in favor of fair housing, roz-ezingist TZT and ability to access access, whether it be custody, orøre years and the pract Czech language, Because we are all human beings And and we don't want criminal export or career hunting or slavery, and ending housing inequity for its citizens. Whereas the international community, in 2022 and 2023, issued recommendations to public officials in the US calling for improved efforts to address systemic discrimination that perpetuates poverty and homelessness and disproportionately harms racialized and other vulnerable populations. Whereas the city, through its mayor and council, reaffirmed the commitment to ensuring housing as a human right through its policy, implementation and enforcement.
Now, therefore, be it resolved that the council of the city of Pittsburgh encourages all agencies, institutions and individuals, public and private, in the city of Pittsburgh, to abide by the letter and the spirit of the fair housing law in pursuit of expanding opportunities and improving the quality of life for all. Be it further resolved that the council of the city of Pittsburgh commits to make every effort to support the citizens of Pittsburgh and the departments, boards, offices and authorities of the city of Pittsburgh in their fight to end discrimination in housing and, affirmatively, further fair housing.
Be it further resolved that the council of the city of Pittsburgh does hereby proclaim April 2025 as fair housing month in the city of Pittsburgh. May we have a motion So moved. Is there a second Second? All those in favor say aye, Aye, Aye, Congratulations. Thank you, Appreciate it.

On behalf of the Urban League, we wanna thank you for all the support. Thank you for all the support that you have provided. That support allows us to advocate for people who are being evicted, people who are facing mortgage foreclosure, people who need a new chance in life and, most importantly, that it builds on the connective tissue of our community. We realize that we cannot do anything without being sure that we look out for each other, And these funds, these programs do that. So thank you. And also, my son worked in this department.

We ask men across the city to get up, get out, take a personal day, vacation day, whatever, and go into any of the Pittsburgh public schools. They have special activities designed to attract men. Okay, What I always tell the principals and administrators when I was on the board is: I will get the men in your building, You find a way to keep them, And they've been very, very successful. Today's date is a day, it's a kickoff, because I think it's important that our children who are watching, that our mothers who are watching and our sisters and our aunts, that they see men, black men, young men, old men, white men- all of us Stand and publically show and say our commitment to children. Kids are under attack today, okay, But we need to stand and show that we are together. So this is what this day's about. Secondly, my hat that I'm wearing- and please forgive me because I normally remove it, but I have to represent, two years ago, one of the activities that happened at Martin Luther King School, the principal, under the leadership of Dr Gordon, had a panel where the majority of the men in the audience and we were able to talk And actually the honorable mayor was part of that panel and I was part of the panel. At the end, as a parting gift, she gave me the hat that said Number One, Dad, and I said Sister, I'm going to represent, So I am here to represent her. But thank you very much.

Thank you, Mr Brentley. This is a really important season for Pittsburgh Public Schools, with lots of hard work and decisions to be made, but a reminder that men show up When men are called, men show up, And so I'm appreciative of the men- men in this room and the men around this district who, even if they can't show up every day for every parent-teacher conference, we know that they are in the lives of our children and we are integral into for the success. so, on behalf of the board of directors of Pittsburgh Public Schools, thank you, president Lavelle, thank you, mr Brintley, thank you, mayor Ganey, and best wishes on the rest of the season. thank you, thank you, mr president, thank you very much and we appreciate all of the in-kind service over the years. next, remember, this year we're focusing and we're going to continue to follow behind dr Walters, who his focus is on reading and he believes that if you can't read, things can be very difficult. so we constantly are pushing and supporting that and we always have our partners. we have two of our wonderful partners and we have a representative from each and we're asking if they would come to the microphone there and say a few words. well, representative from RIF, which is reading is fundamental. take a moment please. my friend Cal, if you can, and then, right with him, is where's our friend from Carnegie Library? there's, there are hang partners. they here today. okay, okay, good, Good morning everyone. First of all, thank you, President and council members, for letting Reading is Fundamental Pittsburgh be a part of this amazing event. Our mission at RIF is to ensure that all kids in the Pittsburgh community have access to books and resources to motivate them to develop a love of reading, and in the past year we provided almost eighty four thousand books on the north side, the south side, the Hill District. Fazon, or Pittsburgh Faison, is the school at Homewood that we serve in Hazelwood and in Wilkinsburg, And my work specifically is in our mentoring program Rip- Everybody Wins, where we match volunteers to read for an hour a week with kids at Pittsburgh Faison in Homewood, at Pittsburgh Weill in the Hill District and at Pittsburgh King on the north side, as well as Manchester Academic Charter School. So today I would just like to reiterate the importance of having adults in kids' lives and the power that reading has to let kids learn more about themselves and learn more about the world. We like to say that books provide windows and mirrors for kids. They can see themselves reflected and their specialness and their importance shown on the page, while also learning about others in our community and in our community. So if you would be interested in reading for an hour a week with kids in one of our schools, we have over 200 mentors this year. I would love to serve more kids next year. You can visit our website, riffpittsburghorg slash mentoring or you can come see me or my colleague Corey and we'll give you a card. But thank you for letting us be part of this event and thank you to everyone in this room for what you do to support the kids here in Pittsburgh. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.

Yes, sir, Yes, sir, Yes, I do. I just quickly. I want to thank everyone here so much for being here, Also the women of Alpha, Kappa, Alpha. So just today, I you know, while you're all still here, because I know you know so. today we're celebrating Take a Father to School Day, We're celebrating the women of Alpha Kappa Alpha, We are celebrating Fair Housing Month And we are celebrating National Community Development Week. And just for the folks in this room, I want briefly to acknowledge some mailers that came to many of your mailboxes over the Easter weekend. Campaigns are campaigns, Politics is politics, So I'm not going to comment on that. However, the implications that 30 years of purposeful neglect and disinvestment in Black communities is the fault or legacy of our first Black mayor is appalling. Attacking the mayor's wife is appalling. Saying that contracts that were awarded to two Black women led organizations that went through the legal, fully vetted RFP process were somehow not transparent or somehow sweetheart deals feeds into the anti-black, anti-inclusion and anti-DEI rhetoric that we are seeing all over the country. It's shameful and I am embarrassed and I feel the need to apologize on behalf of our entire city government. to be quite frank, But I do wanna say that, given this room, all of you, you all worked so hard, you all worked so hard for the betterment of your communities and I want you to know that Pittsburgh sees that, Despite of what's in the media, despite of nasty mailers like this. there are so many people around this city. We see that we recognize that, And so I just wanna thank you all so much for being here today and for all the amazing work that you do. thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you for our chair, But I gotta tell you, councilwoman, as young folks would say, I felt that Thank you. All. right, we're gonna hold just our fist ball in here to show our determination for educating our children and volunteering, and we're just gonna say our cheer. When I say Pittsburgh, you say fathers, And each time you go louder, we do it three times: Pittsburgh Fathers, Pittsburgh Fathers, Pittsburgh Fathers. Thank you, members of council, Thank you, Thank you. Can you guys get in closer together? Come up, you can come to the front here. I'm short, I'm gonna get everybody into. No, I'm gonna take over. hey, councilwoman, come with me. sis, please come with me. nobody, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna. we would like to present to the first person who arrived the signed autograph wall number 51.

**Section of meeting transcript:**
So just some closing thoughts and last but certainly not least, councilman mosley, oh yeah, can mr cooper and and your guests can come up as well. this proclamation is a real treat. you know, i grew up, you know, hearing many stories about the great chuck cooper in my household. my father served in the navy in california with mr cooper as well as played a lot of basketball with mr cooper when they both came back to pittsburgh and i was at pittsburgh when mr cooper went to attend duquesne university and my father was at the university of pittsburgh and obviously mr cooper had the best team. i think he played for the center avenue wide. my dad played for the collegians. this was back in in the in the early 50s. so when me and and mr cooper got to meet about about two years ago, it was really a treat because it was almost like we grew up together, even though we had never met, because my father shared so many stories, and thank you so much for setting up the interview and for being here and for being here and for being here and for being here. i'm actually pretty proud of the fact that we could have an interview with the national basketball association when they came to town a few months ago and allowed my father to share his personal stories of the time that he spent with mr cooper and then allowed me to talk about the kind of historical significance of of mr cooper and what he means to the city of pittsburgh. what he needs means the game of basketball, and i look at this as today is really the beginning of a year-long celebration to the great milestone that began 75 years ago on friday. so Whereas Charles Henry Cooper, born September 29th 1926 to Daniel and Emma Cooper in Pittsburgh, PA Charles, affectionately known as Chuck, was a proud graduate of Westinghouse High School class of 1944, After graduation Chuck briefly played a semester of college basketball at West Virginia State College, now University, before his service in the US Navy during World War II, And whereas after serving in the US Navy, Mr Cooper enrolled at Duquesne University where he started all four years and set the school record for total points of 990 points in one season Mr Cooper's team had a 78-19 record and was invited to the then prestigious National Invitational Tournament twice. And whereas on April 25th 1950, Mr Cooper became the first African American ever drafted into the National Basketball Association and was drafted by the Boston Celtics. He was the first African American to be drafted into the National Basketball Association, led by owner Walter Brown and coached by the legendary Red Auerbach, and was the teammate of the great Bob Cousy, among many others, Mr Cooper played a total of 409 NBA games, scoring 2,725 points, 2,431 rebounds and 733 assists. And very recently, and long overdue, Mr Cooper was enshrined in the National Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts. Now, in his assessment of his current career, Mr Cooper- careless of course because he was thinking about the World Cup in principio- was finally summoned to the plötzlich and shocking surging ihn. in the Dd of 1995, Nielsen These victory mentioned a punchline to indicate who he was and why. Peter King peace Speaker. the facts: It was unclear and most honest in history for Mr Cooper'setta. junto. beautiful city, Pittsburgh has hereby respect and isn't recognized and congratulate Charles Chuck Cooper for his commitment to community, serving his country, shattering racial barriers as well as barriers here in the City of Pittsburgh Is after his basketball career. after a basketball career, he worked in the banking industry, locally as an executive and was theınd game department head. so again, you know his trailblazing. history goes far beyond the hard court into the halls of corporate america as well as city government. so be it further resolved that the council of the city of pittsburgh does hereby declare friday, april 25th 2025 to be charles chuck cooper day in the city of pittsburgh. may we have a motion so move second. all those in favor say aye, aye, congratulations. thank you so much. you know to have a day recognized and my father honor is just a tremendous accomplishment. and i just can't thank councilman mosley enough for not only his, his great work and leadership in the city of pittsburgh, but he's a big supporter of the chuck cooper foundation and council president lavelle, we have a history as well. the house that i grew up in was purchased by, was purchased from the vale real estate, his family's business back in the day. so i heard, heard his name a lot, my household and it ended up being connected to this council body. it was back in 1970 when my father became the first black city department director. it needed approval of city council. so i feel connected to each and every one of you and thank you for your hard work. public officials don't get as much credit as you deserve for what you put in. it's a sacrifice to not only you but the people who are involved in the city of pittsburgh and the city of pittsburgh and the city of puerto rico. so i want to thank you, you for your hard work and dedication. it was 1950, april 25th, in a smoke field room in in chicago, illinois, it was boston turn the pick. it was in the second round but it was the 13th overall pick and walter brown, the owner of celtics, stood up and said boston takes chuck cooper, the all-american, out of duquesne university. and when the owner said you can't take him, he's colored- i think he used a different word, but at least that's how i was reported today. and walter brown was the first black city department executive of the city council in the city of puerto rico and he was a real affluent man. he was the first black city department and he was the first black city department and he was the first black mayor of puerto rico and he was a former mayor of puerto rico and he was the first black. And Walter Brown said: I don't give a damn If he's straight, poke it out or play it, Boston takes Chuck Cooper And the rest was history. And he went on and had a great rookie season with the Boston Celtics, made the all-rookie team, was in contention for rookie of the year and really enjoyed his time in Boston, Came back to Pittsburgh, like Councilman Moseley said, continued to break barriers in city government and also at Pittsburgh National Bank. But back in those days it wasn't easy. He actually only stayed in his department as director of Parks and Recreation for a little over a year. That was reported in Pittsburgh paper. They asked him why he resigned. He said: listen, I've been the first on a few occasions, but never once have I been a token and I won't start now. But one thing he did accomplish was he had East Hills Park, which is probably one of the most beautiful community parks, finished and built up in East Hills. So he was very proud of that, because the kids up there didn't have anywhere to play. So I'm really honored to be able to get, And I'm really honored to be able to continue to push his legacy forward through the work of the Chuck Cooper Foundation. I started that organization back in 2013. Since then we've awarded 400,000 in scholarships and we outreach to thousands of kids to our Beacons of Light outreach program. That, too, has been a sacrifice. I thank my beautiful, lovely wife, Shelly Cooper, for being here. I'll never forget. I got laid off in the pharmaceutical industry. She said: what are you going to do now? Are you going to go to a competitor? I said no, I think I'm going to start a company. I said, no, I think I'm going to start a company, But I think I've got a foundation from scratch. So I don't know how we made it, but we got through. But again, it truly is an honor and a pleasure to be here and to be able to work with young people. elevate my father's name, And just a couple of quick things that you might not be aware of. As Constable Mosley said, he got inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2019. Right now, at Duquesne University, there's actually two buildings on campus named in his honor: UPMC Cooper Fieldhouse. that you might have heard about, But if you go to the Mary Lemieux statue, caddy corner is the Chuck Cooper building. and and also, if you're in the NBA or you're in a Western Conference and you win the Pacific Division Championship, you get a beautiful Chuck Cooper trophy. so I couldn't have done it without some tremendous professionals who helped me grow and develop the Chuck Cooper foundation: people like Tom Rooney, Zach Thomas, Matt Mead, Bob Durda- I could go on and on, but I couldn't do it without their tremendous support. a law firm, Buchanan, Eggersom, Rooney were tremendous supporters, but I can go on and on, but we get tremendous amount of corporate support. I got a shout out: UPMC and UPMC, health plan, Highmark and many others, so just I really want to thank you again for this incredible recognition and wish you all the best. thank you so much. I got a couple jerseys. if we could bring them up for a photo out? yeah, absolutely, yeah, all right, I'd love to take a picture with a Chuck, okay, yeah, members could come up as well. I would love to have them come up. anybody with this guy? a couple jerseys, oh my god, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, thank you, thank you, I appreciate it. yeah, mm-hmm, okay, yeah, I love that. okay, that's it. yes, cool, thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.

2. Managed natural landscapes may include but are not limited to rain gardens, native gardens, and pollinator gardens, or any combination of these gardens.

 

3. Managed natural landscapes shall have a distinct and clearly defined border, which may consist of any combination of mowed grass, fencing of up to four feet in height, a permitted fence installed along a property line, or natural materials arranged to create a defined edge to contain the managed natural landscape.

 

4. Managed natural landscapes shall not include any plantings, which, due to location, manner of growth, or encroachment into a right-of-way, constitute a hazard to the public or may cause injury or damage to persons or property when such growth is in violation of Chapter 1004 of this code.

 

5. Managed natural landscapes shall not include any plant deemed to be a weed under Chapter 1004 of this code.

1.                     Any owner of record of a property, and any tenant upon signed, written consent of the property owner must register their Managed Natural Landscape with the City department responsible for inspection of residential overgrowth violations. Registration shall include but not be limited to the following:

2.                     Upon a finding of a violation of the terms of the section, the enforcement agency may require the owner, agent, or occupant of the property to cut and destroy the weeds or plant growth after service of a notice violation.

 

3.                     Upon failure to comply with the notice of violation, the property owner, agent, or occupant may be subject to further penalty in accordance with Section 106.3 of the City’s Property Maintenance Code at Chapter 1004 of this code.

 

(g) Effective Date

Unless otherwise specifically stated, the provisions of this Section shall become effective on January 1, 2026.

**Section of meeting transcript:**
finally, That takes us to motions and resolutions. Anything from members, Councilman Smith and then Councilman Coghill. Thank you, I just want to wish our colleague, Councilman Wilson, a speedy recovery from his surgery. but I also want to ask, Madam Clark, when we have the appointees come forward for the interviews, please make sure that they all have their financial interest statements filled up in advance So that we have them and can look at them. Thank you, Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Coghill. Thank you, Mr President. In case you haven't heard, we had an instance where an ambulance was responding to a cardiac arrest while they were there or on their way. I'm not quite sure how it transpired, but we had to dispatch another ambulance there because the ambulance broke down. So, and my point is, we're not going to be able to get the ambulance to the hospital, So we're going to have to get the ambulance to the hospital. We're going to have to get the ambulance to the hospital, We're going to have to get the ambulance to the hospital. So I think again, I think that the point is, if you'll remember, I think two years ago, come this, come May Two years ago, I had a post agenda on the entire fleet, Specifically the entire fleet, But this has prompted me to want to call it another post agenda to schedule another post agenda, Just really focused solely around public safety. I think we'll do it around EMS, fire and police. We'll leave public works and the others out of it for now. I think we'll do it around EMS, fire and police. We'll leave public works and the others out of it for now. But one of the things I'm going to have to act on is whether or not we're able to do a shift on the aftercare and then, if we can get these efforts, I think we can get them back on board, as we do. but, but those three, because they're life-saving departments, that, and i'm truly really concerned about the fleet overall, and i just want to hear from the directors again and see what kind of what the state is. since, two years ago, being on the equipment leasing authority board, i can tell you it's not much better because we have not made the infusion of cash that we need there. so so, but but but i just want to hear from them personally, and you know i know a lot of people are concerned about it, and when i hear stories like that- which happened, i believe, just a couple days ago- it piques my concern. so so, with that, i'd like to schedule a post agenda around public safety, specifically ems, police and fire. thank you, is there a second sir? all in favor? say aye, hi, hi, we'll work with the clerk to get that. thank you, anything else from council president? yes, so i can't raise my hand in the virtual option, but thanks for calling me. i wanted to just recognize councilwoman cal smith. thanks for the speedy recovery note, much appreciated. everything's going well and just so the public knows that it's non-life-threatening to the public set. but it is something i just want to take care of for my health. so thank you, thank you everyone. i just wanted to also thank councilmember cog hill, because you know i appreciate his leadership in terms of the attention to public safety as public safety chair and calling for this post agenda. i hope we can have this sooner or later. you know, given the the circumstances that you know what you just heard from him, you know, hopefully sometime next week we can get this scheduled. you know, i believe it's more of an emergency than anything else. it's about time we have this conversation out in the open. we had it at the budget hearing, but it deserves another, another look behind the curtain here, because when ambulances are breaking down on the way to call something. that's seriously wrong. that's just not bad luck. that's the lack of investments, investment in, in, basically the basics. so, you know, i believe in our ems crews. they're out there doing their jobs, giving everything they got. least we can do is give them the equipment that works. if you know, if you drop a truck for a living, you know, like my dad did, you need that truck to run. so same goes for ambulances. we've kicked this, this, this can down the road. you know far enough about replacing these rigs. so, looking forward to catching up on this conversation, and the public's the one that's gonna, you know, pay the price in the end if we don't fix it. so i'm backing this post agenda because i i believe we owe it to the people who call now on one and the professionals who show up to help. so, looking forward to not, you know, stop patching things up and let's start fixing them right. thanks, thank you. any other member?
