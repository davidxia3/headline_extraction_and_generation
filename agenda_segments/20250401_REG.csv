SECTION 2. Because the agreements provide services on an as-needed basis, expenditures under these agreements will be identified when work orders are issued. If funding for any work order has not been previously appropriated, funding will be identified and appropriated through subsequent City Council action.  Funding is available as appropriated when listed per project in the Operating and/or Capital Budget.

",Open-Ended Professional Services Contracts Add 27 Unspecified New Vendors,"- Open-ended professional services contracts allow vendors to provide on-call professional services for work orders estimated to cost $100,000 or less.
- The program’s goal is to enable City departments to contract services on a rolling basis without seeking Council approval for each request.
- Services include architecture, interior design, and historic consulting, among others.
- New vendors will be added to the program on a rolling basis, but any new additions will require Council approval.
- Councilperson Charland expressed concern that the “fairly self-governing” system of distributing work could lead departments to overlook minority contractors.","Resolution 2025-1639 authorizes fifty-six additional Open-End Professional Services Agreements with multiple vendors for professional services for the City of Pittsburgh, unanimously passed by eight council members.","**Section of meeting agenda:**

",Portable Restroom Back Payment Sparks Inquiries into the Prevalence of Closed Public Restrooms in City Parks,"- A bill covering $35k in expenses for portable bathrooms led to a discussion about the number of broken permanent public restrooms in the city’s parks.
- Director Hornstein of the Department of Public Works did not have an exact count of closed public restrooms to share with Council.
- There are 20 open public restrooms in city parks.
- To restore inoperable restrooms, Director Hornstein stated that public approval and tax funding would be needed for:
  - An assessment of which restrooms are closed and what repairs and maintenance are required.
  - The actual repairs and maintenance, which will likely be significant given how long some have been closed.
  - A program to maintain the restrooms once they are reopened.
- The city spent $219,000 on portable restrooms in parks that lack functioning permanent public restrooms.
- Council members agreed that there should be a plan to begin addressing this long-standing issue.","Resolution 2025-1664 was passed unanimously by the city council, authorizing a $35,025.00 warrant to United Rentals for portable restroom rentals and servicing across the city's parks system.","**Section of meeting agenda:**
