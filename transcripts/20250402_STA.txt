I live at 715 Mercer Street, that's at the top of Befford Avenue in the high-rise with 192 apartments. I come today with a very glad heart and very happy to be here to be able to tell you what I'm getting ready to explain today. And then one last thing. Okay, Wenn, we have comments that we need. we would like to welcome the next Ludha from the to say: I want to say to the Delta fail, Delta Sigma self, I can't pronounce it. you see it, you can read it. this is the alumni that was this room full of women all in red. I wanted to say to them that because of you, these women that were here and that read, I have renewed hope. I give you praise and honor. now, what it is is. I say that gins give proclamations every day, every week, and when they get their proclamation, you give them honor and praise. they walk out, talking, making noise. they don't stay to listen to us. if Dr Miller is standing, you'll tell him to speak and he says, no, let them go. I should be able to speak without them and you get really ignorant with him. do you understand that yesterday, when all those beautiful women sat here, the whole, the whole room full of women of all colors, all sizes, who sat and listened to us, the people, for three minutes apiece? it was only about four of us- has 12 minutes. those women sat and they looked in the eye, whereas I say: this table, we need to get your back to us and make sure that you're doing the right thing and you're doing the right thing. miss gross is there. you're all around her. you don't have to look us in the eye. they should make you sit like they do over at County Council. you have to look at us, not with the backs to us. I want you to understand that I am tired, but there was a young white girl. do you remember what she said? she got up. she didn't say her name. I wish I knew her name. she says: I sit here and I'm watching you. she's angry, like I am. I've been coming for years and finally we have a young woman that's fob and felt to save my Time. I did. she wasn't gonna speak, but she got so angry at you. she says: you should listen to these people. do you understand three minutes of your time? and we say: there, ours, the same way with the women- three yesterday, all these beautiful women of color, all straight. even within comes women and I'm gonna shoot within you. I'm gonna be the fan. I am not a fan. that shows you the disrespect you have. I don't have it in os misunderstandings. oh, up your hands when you say just bring them things in the room times. as long as I understand what you're saying when I mean the women- and we're talking during here agriculture woman didn't stay in the 85 days to meet you When I said è minded pois không where the regular home here in, and you're sitting back behind us and we say something and you got your father in arms who jumps up and comes to us. That's all a form of intimidation. I'm tired of it and I mean you need to stop it. But anytime that the young white people see it, I'm doing okay. Next speaker, please. Good morning. Special Agent Sunshine. how's everybody? Yesterday I made an announcement about Port Authority's upcoming meeting that none of the workers knew when or where. I found where the meeting for April 17th at 8. 30 will be held: at Neil H Holmes Boardroom, Heinz 57 Building, 345, 6th Avenue, 5th floor. Please, if anybody wants to come in, if anybody has any issues with Port Authority as a rider or a driver or an employee at large, please come to this meeting. I will be there to help you address some of your issues. Lord, please use me as a vessel to do your will, not mine. Thank you for touching my heart and giving me a heart to stand before these people and let them know that you're real and so is your wrath. That's coming for y'all. I can't make it up. it's coming. Y'all really gotta prepare for it, Thank you. Thank you. 1 Peter 4. 14 says: the spirit of glory and of God rests on you. Orville Wright, which is one of the Wright brothers that created the human flight, conquered human flight with the airplane. he observed that no bird soars in a calm, And that means that adversity can often be exactly what you need to give you a lift higher. The joy of the bird was not getting to the top of the mountain. their joy was climbing the mountain. So this climb that I'm in with the adversity that I faced with your guys- fraud in our government- the joy that I get is being able to stand here before you and be used by the most high God to shine a light on it, so the whole world can see what it really is, what's really going on in our world and in our government. It's not fair. People need to be made aware And they will be through me In Jesus' name, Lord willing. Proverbs 19. 9- I've been screaming for a while now- says a false witness will not go unpunished and a liar will be destroyed. The liar in my case is the person who stole my identity. who's out here trying to make the world believe that they're me and they're not? I'm who I am. I am who I am. Isn't that what God said? It's amazing. Rejoice in as much as you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed. If you're insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the spirit of glory and of God rests on you. Yesterday I mentioned, somebody said that I didn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out. I don't need those things to be who I am. I don't need a house, a mansion, a car, not even a job, because I work for the Lord. that makes me who I am. He created me, He makes my heartbeat, He gives me every breath that I take and I stand on it in Jesus name, Amen. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. All right, let's try to go back to Ms Mosey. All right, we can hear you. Yes, we can. Oh, thank God, Sorry. Okay, back in. this is Bernadette from Beach Hue. Back in my paralegal college days I was surrounded by teachers. there were lawyers and judges. research everything in life before you do anything and everything they instructed And oh, the smell of those law library books upstairs. I was like a kid in a candy store. I loved it And I discovered. I loved it From scriptures, history, local history, ancient history and family history research and even connecting lost families. I love research for free, because it's my passion and my gift from God. It's my calm and my old age. The same professor said: research before a job interview to be prepared. Well, I think, due to the recent kerfuffles in Washington, we need to add research, Research before you accept campaign funds. We should research as a voter too. As a voter, I don't want to vote for a person who makes a deal in campaign promises with South African style musk rats. A recent campaign article shared mega light campaign buying surrounding quarry Sole buying. I call it Those mega donors. I call campaign cartels. accept them and they control you and your citizens. So I researched And we have a big time campaign cartel, courtroom docket junkie Number one. leading the numbers of courtroom docket junkies and mega campaign donors, Walnut Capital, Hundreds and hundreds of court cases and multiple LLCs. I checked Allegheny County, Westmoreland County and, this morning, Butler, And just the three counties. since yesterday I was able to research. Walnut spends more time, and much too much time, in court. The recovery of court junkie time is not being passed on to their grandmothers. It's passed on to our citizens, our renters, our buyers, our government contracts pass on to voters experiencing life. I'm sorry. any company spending so much time getting a new LLC and needs a special speedy file window in multiple county for You probably don't want them under the campaign sheets of favors. When does it become too much? When does the young, new starting out small companies get a chance? When the control seeps in like a muskrat, controlling politicians and voters, does it become too much, but too late? Have a good day. Thank you very much. Is there anyone else in chambers wishing to speak? If you need any questions, please, If If you want to speak, Please give us your name, neighborhood. for the record, My name is Hudayfa Ibn Abdullah Hakeem Ismaili and I'm just here to see how government works, to watch y'all and see what's going on. Thank you very much for being here. With that, we will turn to our standing committee agenda. Members, before you is a letter from the mayor asking to rescind the appointment of Jesse Durenna, And so I want to take that bill first. So someone would please offer a motion to add bill 1346 back to our agenda. So move Second. Second, All those in favor say aye, Aye, Aye. And now, if someone would offer a motion to withdraw, Say: Do you want me to read it? Oh, sorry, I'm moving too fast. The clerk should read the bill. I apologize. Yes, Bill 2024. 1346 Resolution appointing Jesse Durenna as a member of the Commission on Infrastructure Asset Reporting and Investment, with a term to expire July 3rd 2027. All right, Now that the bill has been read, if someone would offer a motion to withdraw this appointment, So moved Second. All those in favor say aye, Aye, We will have been withdrawn. That will now take us to our finance and law committee, chaired by Councilman Schwarzberger. We have one deferred paper, Bill 1572. Bill 1572 resolution authorizing the City of Pittsburgh to accept the sum of 316,367 in full and final settlement of litigation filed in the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas involving the Finland Street Pedestrian Bridge. Motion to approve Second brief discussion. Brief discussion. Councilman Gross, Thank you. I appreciate the administration meeting with me over this bill. It was an executive session. I think I'm supportive today- but I just wanted to say on the record that my concerns around pedestrian safety on this section of Bigelow Boulevard- This is a settlement, so it's not really anything that we can do much about- right, We've settled with. you know we've settled with the. you know we've settled with the. you know we've settled with the. you know we've settled with the. I think the company that caused damage to the Finland Street Pedestrian Bridge that went over Bigelow so severely that it had to be taken down, But that leaves us without that pedestrian infrastructure there. And then, if you'll recall, this is a pedestrian bridge that's in between the pedestrian bridge at the Bigelow, at the Bloomfield Bridge on Bigelow, And then, as you're inbound, it's going to be the installation. then your next safe crossing is at Heron Avenue, which is actually not very safe and we're working on and it is real concern for the neighborhood, and there are bus stops on either side. So you may be living uphill from Bigelow and needing to cross, or you may be living below hill on Bigelow and needing to cross to get to Port Authority bus stops. And so my ask is for Delmay to really do an audit of pedestrian safety and give suggestions of things that can be done. So that is still to be worked out. So right now you are able to cross at Heron and you're able to cross at the Bloomfield Bridge. So with that, I just wanted to get that on the record and it is work that remains in front of us. But I'm supportive of this bill today, which is just receiving funds from a legal settlement. Any further discussion? If not, I'll simply note that your concerns about that stretch of Bigelow are well founded and very understood. You said it before. but it's also worth noting that there used to be an underpass at the Heron Avenue intersection where you could go under the street, and the state decided to close that with no alert to the city. They just decided to do it. So your concerns are well founded. All those in favor say aye, Aye. Any opposed Aye. Affirmative recommendation. That moves us to the new papers. bill 1660. Bill 1660 resolution authorizing the issuance of two warrants in the total sum of 32,000 over one year. It is further understood and agreed that the payment schedule of the total settlement amount shall be as follows: 16,000 payable to Scott Allen Beatty, 16,000 payable to Samuel J Cordes Esquire in full and final settlement of litigation filed in the United States District Court for the Western District Court of Pennsylvania. The bill is passed. Thank you, Any opposed Aye? Any opposed Aye Next bill. 1660 resolution authorizing the mayor and the director of the Office of Management and Budget to enter into an agreement or agreements with USI Insurance Services for insurance brokerage services for all necessary policy types. This shall be a no cost payment to any insurance brokerage services for all necessary policy types. Motion agreement with a term of three years with two one-year options to extend. motion to approve brief discussion. second, I'm not sure I understand what this is. frankly, if it's a no cost, how can we have a no cost service? it's insurance brokerage. admittedly, I'm not. I apologize, I have not been briefed on this either. do we have anyone from the audience? Patrick Cornell, if you please come forward? sure, Jennifer, sorry I didn't see you over there I always. good morning, Patrick Cornell, chief financial officer. Jennifer Olesinger, chief procurement officer. so this is the end of an RFP for insurance brokerage services. it is a no-cost contract. that is because insurance policies are paid by the actual insurance providers as commissioned directly to the broker. so we will not pay this firm, but we will pay for the policies after the insurance broker is approved. so we will not pay this firm, but we will pay for the policies after the insurance broker has procured them on our behalf. curious standard for the industry and, and this is for all it says, all types of insurance policies. yes, when I just give us a really brief reminder of all of the types of insurance that we carry: we have a property coverage on our buildings. we have boat insurance. we have insurance for cameras that we have on property that is not ours, so if a camera falls and breaks or whatever on somebody else's property, it would cover any damage. we have a cybersecurity insurance. we have errors and emissions insurance for EMS and we have crime insurance for officers, elected officials. well, that was impressive and we proved our previous broker that that contract has expired. so we did a new RFP and we are actually we're switching brokers to a different. wonderful. what is the timeline that we expect to see you come back to the table for your so we good question? we wouldn't need to come back for those individual policies as they would just be routed through this, this broker, but the new policies would go into effect may 1. I do this all the time. I ask questions and then I start pulling on threads. I'm sorry, so I don't like these wide open, blanket kinds of papers. so that to requesting to enter into a brokerage is one thing, but that you've, if you've, embedded approval of the resulting policies in the same bill, that makes me cranky. so is that what's happening in front of us here? yes, the only thing I would add is that within OMB, City Council has approved the insurance premium payments in the current budget, and we're going to be able to get that back to you in the next couple of weeks. so I'm just going to go ahead and ask you a question and then I'll get back to you in a minute. so I'm going to go ahead and ask you a question and then I'll get back to you in a minute. so I'm going to go ahead and ask you a question and then I'll get back to you in a minute. so I'm going to go ahead and ask you a question and then I'll get back to you in a minute. so I'm going to in the regular budget process, not the same thing. we also have contract approval authority and so it having a sequence of events of contracts seems a little expiry- quiero tener unINKAL- tales a little- but is transparent. an it's our responsibility to protect and make sure there's transparency and things. I'm not going to belabor this today because I wasn't prepared. maybe I'm misunderstanding what I'm hearing, so I'll So I'll leave it there, but I will think about it before final vote. Appreciate it. That's all I have, Mr Chair, Thank you. Any further discussion Seeing none. all those in favor say aye, Aye. Any opposed. Any abstentions: Affirmative recommendation. That takes us to Bill 1662.

I believe- and excuse my ignorance- Fiona could probably help with this. Come on up, we're gonna bring her up, okay, I just feel like we've never done this before. Right, is this the first time for the? I'm sorry, you'll have to introduce yourself, Fiona Kalman, DBA for Public Safety at the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. So this is like. I don't remember seeing one of these bills before. is this a new thing for us That the police department has done? Yeah, Yeah. so we did go out nationally on OpenGov, bid out and then made sure that we met all compliances, and that has taken the process a lot more months than it typically would, but check the boxes and do what we could. So again, I don't know why I'm asking these questions, but it's new and it's interesting, Is it that they're gonna be filming here And so they're making shorts, and not necessarily in this room, but in Pittsburgh, Yes, Yes, With our officers. Yes, Yes, As far as what it's gonna look like, I don't know why it's entertaining. Okay, everybody's laughing, it's not just me, okay. Okay, so it's a recruitment video and we're paying 30,000 from a grant, so we're not really anything out of pocket, and hopefully it'll help with recruitment because it'll get on social media or digital media or someplace, And the company that we're going with, Yeah, We've also produced police videos for other cities as well, so they're qualified And it works, Hoping it works. yeah, we plan on having it work, But it worked in the other cities. Yeah, Oh, okay, That's great, all right. so I'm just thanks for answering my questions. I was just, you know, like I said, it's new, and so I was just curious how it was gonna work. Okay, Thank you. Yeah, that's all I have, Mr Chair. Thank you, Councilman. Sorry, There's nothing worse than a poorly timed, so I'll let you tickle. So I'm interested in this. I think we all are interested because it's a new thing, But I'm really glad to see you know. I think the last I heard is that we're starting to see recruitment number or the number of applicants, I should say, starting to go up again, which Correct, I believe is great. Can you talk to us about that at all? Sure, and I don't have the exact numbers, but kind of as a rough example, this, you know: past month, at the civil service examination that's tested monthly, we had roughly 170 people sign up to take it. i think 90 actually showed up, which is over double what we've seen in months prior. so too early to celebrate completely, but it seems our recruitment team, recruitment efforts are starting to bear fruit. that's that's something, something you should, you know, applaud yourself for and and the team that's working on this. that's quite, you know, really something to celebrate here. i, you know i think i've told the story at the table before, but i was in new york in the fall and i saw, you know, i was riding the subway and i saw advertisements like they have in their in their subway saying come join the police force. but it was come join the police force in atlanta. atlanta was advertising in new york subways. so this is is something that i think everybody's trying to figure out: how to be creative and and how to. you know, it's a nationwide issue. how do, how do we get to that point where we're, you know, keeping up with the joneses in terms of recruiting. so i'm i'm glad to see, you know, a video. i'll should probably use officer andre as your, as your, your actor here. i i don't, i don't know, i'm just i, i don't know. yeah, we're going to need volunteers. andre wright is, is your, your ham? so, but yeah, i mean, i i'm excited to see it and excited to see what comes out of this and i hope this bears fruit. so cool idea, thank you, thank you. any further discussion? seeing none. just, just, real, quickly, i just wanted to add: would you send us once, if approved, today, which and then tuesday it'll be final. would you send us all the, the actual product that you get? can you just email that to us? is that how you do that or what you know? like the video? yeah, what? yeah, i'm sure. yeah, right, yeah, i'll be able to send and share and okay, good, yeah, probably a couple months down the road, but, yeah, right, yeah, yeah, i'm just saying like, so we could see it. yeah, that's it, okay, good, can the council? that's it for me, mr president, he wants to be in there. well, i was going to pitch myself. but i mean, you are the public safety. i think i'm available. i mean, if you give me the dates and the times, i'll check my schedule. people often think you do look like a concept. you know what i might open that week. as a matter of fact, i pretend to be one. yeah, you look like one. that's it, mr president. sorry, we're gonna carry it away, thank you. i have one question: does this conflict in any way with our union cable workers? i know the rfp went out a long time ago. i know one of the concerns was the capability in terms of use of drones etc. i can't speak completely to that. i don't know. thank you, any further discussion seeing none. all those in favor say aye, aye. any opposed affirmative recommendation. thank you for being here, thank you. thank you, guys, thanks. that takes us to public works and infrastructure committee shared by councilman warwick. our first new paper is bill 1663. i'll be available. bill 1663 resolution amending resolution number 615 of 2024, entitled. resolution authorizing the mayor of the city of pittsburgh and the director of the office of management and budget to apply for a grant from the pennsylvania department of community and economic development's multimodal transportation fund for the smallman street complete street project. the grant proposal includes an ask of two million two hundred seventy nine thousand six hundred sixty two dollars and thirty cents, with a local match of one hundred seventeen thousand one hundred dollars from the 2024 capital budget for a total grant project cost of two million three hundred ninety six thousand seven hundred sixty two dollars and thirty cents. to accept the grant budget proposed. treating his Settings: Austin capital project and promoting Open Med pequele hundred seventy-nin degrees. absense of a graphic buyouts over over the like engineering, final design, right of way and construction phases of the planning process. title will be licensed between closer to testing steps and to moving or meeting the pre-short tapering project program. toARC. right of way and building construction phases of of the Liberty Avenue Highway Safety Improvement Program, providing for the payment of the cost thereof not to exceed 12,905,556- an increase of 5,400,000 from the previously authorized amount, and the municipal share of commonwealth incurred costs not to exceed 29,700, an increase of 24,200 from the previously authorized amount.

I'm assuming you're in by substitution, so take both of those together. yeah. motion to amend. second: brief discussion discussion. yes, i just wanted to provide some context. you know this has been part of a multi-year process that started before my tenure on council between neighborhood groups and larmer neighborhood groups in east liberty, the developer as well as my predecessor, reverend burgess. that resulted in a community benefits agreement which includes the build 100 program that my office now has taken the lead on, working with the developer and the community groups. that will result and at some point in the future, of 100 affordable homes for purchase in the eastern community, particularly in larmer, but it may extend into lincoln, levington and homewood at some point and also- this is part of negotiations that i participated in with the mayor- that will include a 10 affordable rental housing on site at 50 ami and then 5 at 80 to 120 ami and that'll. there's just information in that as well. but this is just to send this over, you know, for a public hearing. i know there's going to be a lot of robust conversation and consideration about this. i welcome that. i look forward to discussing this further, but i do want to applaud the larmer consensus group and the village collaborative for the hard work that they've done over the last three or four years, you know, to move this forward. so i just want to give a little bit of context of what we're looking at. and again, this is part of a community benefits agreement negotiation that took place between the communities, as well as more recent negotiations between the mayor's office and myself around some on-site affordability. that was not part of the original community benefits agreement. all the affordability was going to be off-site and we were able to negotiate on-site affordability as well. so i just want to provide some context. thank you, so we have an amendment by substitution on the table. is there any further discussion? councilman, will you just tell me what? you said it, but i didn't catch it. what are the amis? affordability, off-site- i believe it's going to be 80 ami for affordable home purchase and then on-site it will be 50% at 50 and 5% at 80 to 120. okay, thank you. any further discussion? if none, i'll simply congratulate you. i do remember when reverend burgess sort of started this and for you to now be able to get it. it's not fully across the finish line, but there i know there's been a lot of work to reach both consensus within the neighborhood as it relates to both the off-site affordability and the four home, the home ownership opportunities, as well as the on-site affordability. so i congratulate you on that and i hope that you will continue to do that. and i hope that you will continue to do that and i hope that you will continue to do that. and i know you've been working on this since you took office, so there's been a lot of work to get to this point. so i just want to congratulate you, and i also want to congratulate sean carter, because i know you were working on this long before i was. so all those in favor say aye, aye, aye. any opposed? so the bills have been amended by substitution. now you, i believe these have to be held for a public hearing. so if you want to make a motion to hold both bills for cable cars public hearing, most of the whole. for a cable cast public hearing. second, all those in favor say aye, aye, aye, any opposed. both bills will be held for a cable cast public hearing. that takes us to intergovernmental and educational affairs committee, chaired by councilman mosley. we have one deferred paper: bill 1589. bill 1589 resolution authorizing the mayor and director of the department of mobility and infrastructure, on behalf of the city of pittsburgh, to enter into a cooperation agreement with pittsburgh regional transit for post construction of the city of pittsburgh, which is creating a highway out of the ownership, access and maintenance of certain city steps to be constructed around Downing Street in the sixth ward of the city of Pittsburgh at no cost to the city. motion to hold for six weeks. second, all those in favor say aye, aye. any opposed. bill be held six weeks. that takes us to our new papers, and the first is bill 1657. well, 1657 resolution amending resolution 21 of 2025, which authorized a cooperation agreement or agreements with the city of Pittsburgh equipment leasing authority for the purchase and leasing of vehicles, equipment and accessories, equipment, support, infrastructure and professional services in fiscal year 2025, by increasing the authorized amount by ninety three thousand dollars to purchase vehicles and equipment for the office of community health and safety, for a new total of seven million nine hundred ninety nine thousand three hundred nineteen thousand three hundred ninety nine thousand three hundred nineteen dollars and thirty seven cents. motion to approve any discussion seeing none. all those in favor say aye, aye. opposed affirmative recommendation: bill 1658: well, 1658 resolution providing for an amended reimbursement agreement or agreements with Pittsburgh water for costs associated with the Haverhill project, where Pittsburgh water is overseeing the design and construction of the storm water management component, of the storm water management component, as well as the door, roadway replacement and rehabilitation, and has a has or will retain the services of a design consultant, construction management, inspection consultant and construction contractor for the project. the city will reimburse Pittsburgh water for this work at a cost to the city not to exceed nine hundred ninety two thousand six hundred twenty eight dollars and seventy seven cents. an increase of three hundred eighty two thousand five hundred and fifty nine thousand six hundred twenty eight dollars and seventy seven cents. an increase of three hundred eighty two thousand five hundred thirty dollars and thirty cents from the previously authorized resolution. motion to approve: second, second, any discussion seeing none. all those in favor, say aye, aye. any opposed affirmative recommendation. and lastly, bill 1659. bill 1659 resolution authorizing the mayor and the director of the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure, on behalf of the city of Pittsburgh, to enter into an agility agreement with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation for purposes of exchange, documentation and cooperation with respect to provision of in-kind services between both parties at no cost to the city. motion to approve any discussion. one question just out of curiosity. I'm just curious what agility agreement is. why'd you ask the NFL? that's what they're doing in the NFL, don't they? why'd you ask the NFL? that's what they're doing in the NFL, don't they? this is the director Lucious, hopefully. just one quick question, I'm just just out of curiosity. Kim Lucas, director for the city of Pittsburgh's Department of Mobility and Infrastructure. the agility agreement is a no-cost agreement between us and PennDOT that just tracks things that we basically borrow from them. so in this instance, sometimes we need to use their crash vehicle to help protect the work that we're doing in the right-of-way, and there are sometimes a lot of times we're not able to pay for the work that we're doing in the right-of-way, and there are sometimes a lot of times we're not able to pay for the work, that they need some assistance of that type from us and so this is just a way to not have to pay each other but instead to track sort of what we're borrowing. thank you, thank you. any further discussion if not all those in favor say aye. any opposed affirmative recommendation? I actually want to go back and I apologize because I didn't see this until just now, but I got a note from Patrick Cornell regarding the ability to pay for the work that they're doing in the area and I'm going to go back and I apologize because I didn't see this until just now, but I got a note from Patrick Cornell regarding bill 1675 and councilwoman Strasburgers in the finance, which is regarding councilman's bill to sponsor, which councilman Wilson sponsored a land sale but the real estate team was unaware the parcel was struck from her November resolution and he couldn't immediately tell if it went through the full process again and he wants time to make sure that everything is done by the book with councilman Wilson. he's not against it, he just wants to make sure all I's are dotted and T's are crossed. so if someone wants to make sure that they're not in the way of the plan, then he's not going to be able to get a motion to reconsider the bill 1675 so moved. second, all those in favor say aye, aye. and he's asking for a one-week cold to meet with councilman Wilson to make sure everything is appropriate. so can we make, make a go, make a motion over one week. second, all those in favor say aye. any opposed bill be held for one week. thank you all. that takes us to the end of our agenda. we do have meeting announcements. this afternoon, with sessions at 2 and 3, council will hold a briefing with stout or an affordable housing strategies for Pittsburgh. then on Thursday April 3rd, with sessions at 2 and 3, council will hold a briefing to discuss the conflict of interest policy for public service grant selection process. then next week council will hold our regular meeting on Tuesday April 8th and our sending community meeting on Wednesday April 9th at 10 am. as you register to speak at these meetings and hearings, please for the signup form on accounts meeting web page by the deadline. you may also call the clerk's office at 4: 1, 2, 2, 5, 5, 21, 38. is there anything for members? if no, then we will be back with the next meeting on Tuesday, April 8th, at 10 am. councilman Wilson, I mean mostly. excuse me, I just wanted to mention- I know there's been a lot of talk about the proposed 35% cuts at PRT and just let the public know that the public comment period has opened as of the 31st of March and is open until June 18th. so I strongly encourage anyone who's concerned, as a rider, as a stakeholder, to ensure that your voice is heard and that your voice is heard. there's also meetings coming up on April 29th and June 12th at the David Lawrence Convention Center and those meetings are going to run from 9 am to 1 pm and 3 pm to 7 pm, and then on May 6th, at Soldiers and Sailors Hall, there also will be a hearing from 9 am to 1 pm and 3 pm to 7 pm. so again, I just encourage the public to make their voices heard, as we, as I mentioned before, you know we are, you know, considering, you know, the comprehensive plan and many zoning and planning policies that require a robust public transit system. we talk about transit oriented development and other policy issues. so it's important that we have a robust system. so I ask everyone to let your voice heard so that eventually we may all have to get on a bus to Harrisburg or something like that so we can get that same allotment of money that Philadelphia got last year to protect their public transportation system. so I just wanted to mention that because this is the first week that the public comment has opened up. one more time we would like allovment of money to be spent because we talked to senators in about two weeks and the actual other, leb Proselyto's president, not, thank you, critical, important issue for us, anything else. if not, we need a motion to excuse the absent members, approve the minutes and adjourn the meeting. so move. an Hobby above the Minutes. so moved. All in favor. say aye, Aye, We Are Adjourned, Thank you.
