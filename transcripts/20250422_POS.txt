Good afternoon and welcome to Pittsburgh City Council's cablecast post agenda on Pittsburgh Waters flood mitigation projects for today, April 22nd 2025. We are joined today by Councilmember Sharland, and if we could have our folks from PWSA and the Army Corps of Engineers come on up to the table. Thank you, Do we have Here? we go, All righty, Great, Oh yeah, does someone want to come down to this one here? Yeah, maybe just everyone slide down. What are we doing? I don't know. All right, it's okay, Great, So, yeah. so just to sort of start off to say you know sort of why we're having this post agenda is it was announced by Pittsburgh Water that there's going to be a- I'll say a pause on a number of flood mitigation projects around the city, And one of those is in Pittsburgh. Okay, Okay, Okay, In my district, in Four Mile Run, And so that's why obviously it's of interest to me, but I know that there are a number across the city, So that's, I thought that this would be a good idea. So why don't we have everybody go down the line and introduce yourselves, and then we'll let you, you know, give any presentations or whatnot that you have, and then members can ask questions then, Okay, Thanks, Yeah, I'm Tony Eagle. I'm the Senior Group Manager for Stormwater for Pittsburgh Water. I'm Jen Persutti. I'm the CFO for Pittsburgh Water. I'm Rebecca Zito, Senior Manager of Public Affairs for Pittsburgh Water. I'm Rachel Bean, Chief Engineering Officer for Pittsburgh Water. I am Jen Cristobal. I'm the Planning Section Chief for Army Corps of Engineers. Hi, my name is Mark Locheski. I am the Planning Chief for the US Army Corps of Engineers, Pittsburgh District. Rebecca's bringing up our presentation. I'm Jess Andresen. I'm the Director of theWater Program And I'm the Director of the US Department of Water Resources. And my name is Rachel Beattie And I'm the Director of the US Department of Water Resources. I'm the Director of the US Department of Water Resources And I'm the Director of the US Department of Water Resources. So I want to take an opportunity to thank you very much for calling this post agenda and for inviting us to talk about our stormwater program and all the updates that we can provide to you today. There we go, So on our agenda today. we've gone through the welcome and the introductions. We do want to talk to you all today about our 2025 capital priorities and what makes those priorities in our capital program. Thank you, Tony, will talk to you about our stormwater program. We'll also tell you our rationale for the projects being placed on hold and also what we're looking forward to, how we can help mitigate that. And then, of course, as we end, we're happy to answer any questions that anyone may have. So, as a little bit of background, Pittsburgh Water is a public authority. We serve the public. So you can see, kind of right there in the middle we sit between what would be considered an investor-owned utility and a municipal government. An investor-owned utility has shareholders. they have investors. We have none of that. Every dollar that we collect from our rate payers, it goes right back into our systems. We have a commitment to protecting public health and the environment And we also have drivers of investment. Those are our drivers of investment as well as our rate affordability, which is always top of mind for Pittsburgh Water. Okay, So our water reliability plan is a once-in-a-generation plan. It is a mandated plan for Pittsburgh Water by our regulators. It is court ordered. We have a 470 million investment in critical drinking water infrastructure that we plan to undertake here in the next five to eight years. These are projects that will modernize our water system and improve our service reliability. The design: we're going to be using a lot of water. The design work is currently underway for the capstone project for this plan and that is our clear well replacement. Our clear well is the last point in our disinfection, our treatment process at our water treatment plant before it goes into the distribution system and goes into customers' homes. We have also selected construction firms for our Aspamal pump station and our Brecken pump station. Those are two pump stations that are in need of rehabilitation, As well as our water treatment plant. Okay, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. Okay, Thank you. Okay, Okay, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thanks, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. We are also in the process of building our new Highland pump station. That station is 78% complete at this point. It is our first building that we've constructed, I believe, in the last 20 years Our community-led response. So I'm very proud to announce that we have replaced over 12,000 public-led service lines and over 9,000 private-led service lines. We recently had an event that celebrated our removal of our 12,000th lead service line, which was well attended. We have also consulted with 35 water utilities on lead best practices And these are utilities that have come to Pittsburgh Water to look at our programs, look at our best practices and we counsel them when we can. We are also recognized by the US EPA as a national leader in lead service line replacement programs. So now let's take a look at our capital improvement plan drivers. So you can see at that top line there we have a total investment over the next five years of almost 1. 2 billion. There are four programs that make up almost 80% of that capital improvement plan: The water reliability plan that I just spoke to you all about. that is about 30% of our funding and programming for the next five years. Again, that is a mandated program. We have a consent decree. We have a mandate that mandates that. We also have our lead service line replacement program, which here in Pittsburgh we have pledged to get all of the lead out of our system by 2027, And so you can see, those numbers there make up another 16% of that capital improvement plan. We also have our small and large diameter water replacement, as well as sewer rehabilitation, along with that large and small and large water main replacement program. And then we have our public service line replacement program, which is also our lead service line replacement program, built into that as well. And then, while it's not as flashy as the others, our sewer rehabilitation program is something that is needed, as we are stewards of these public assets to ensure that there is no health or safety issues as well as water quality issues here in Pittsburgh. We have the remaining CIP there, which is 20%, So we have a lot of projects that we need to do to ensure that we can get the best out of our system. So now I'll turn it over to Tony to talk about the stormwater program. Thank you, Thanks, Jen. So, basically, to bring you up to speed on some of the projects that we've completed, a total of 28 stormwater projects, seven of them are currently in planning stages, two under construction And total so far, we've spent upwards of 94 million since 2018 That was invested in the stormwater project, And you can see a nice spread of the projects across the city. So some of the ongoing projects kind of go in a little more detail is the catch basin replacement- About 568 of them have been replaced- And also a lot of the cleaning has taken care of- up to 900 tons- and change of debris that's been removed. Along the same lines, we're continuing with sewer lining and replacement Lining- more than 15 miles of sewer and about one and a half miles have been reconstructed. The green infrastructure project, which we've been doing since after the 2016 green first plan, a lot of projects were implemented that you saw on that map. We've been doing ongoing maintenance and inspection to optimize their performance. One of the things we did this past year was bring a lot of that management in-house moving forward. In addition to that, we still face environmental compliance requirements- A lot of it on our outfalls- that outfall to the rivers and streams, And so there's quite a bit of inspection and protective measures. The inspections are especially after events- storm events- to go out and inspect the system and make sure that we're not impacting water quality in the rivers and streams negatively. In terms of our capital budget, even though a lot of that was ratcheted down, the 2025 is still in the neighborhood of 29 million And a lot of that includes projects that are currently being constructed, like Braywood, the rapid a bus, rapid transit project, the catch basin inlet replacement we've talked about. There is money in there to complete as much as possible the design of the four mile run, And we're going to be doing that, We're going to be doing that, We're going to be doing that, We're going to be doing that. There's a lot of work that needs to be done to get that done And then we're going to be looking at how we're going to do that And then we're going to be looking at how we're going to get a new stormwater improvement system. do some planning for Fowler Park with the parks and the city departments, The Oak Ridge storm sewer separation- that one actually has to go forward because we're taking illicit connections out of the system and putting them back in storm sewers. There are other projects outside flats and woods run also earmarked for construction. So the part that is still coming down the pipe is the what a consent decree. We're still in negotiations with Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Justice, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and County Health. So there's quite a few alphabet soup regulatory agencies involved. We got a draft consent decree beginning of towards the end of the year- October, November- But with the change in Washington DC leadership that's kind of come to a halt for a little bit until the current, The new administration. The new administration figures out their priority of enforcement. While they're doing that, we're still moving forward and doing evaluation of the capacity of the sewer system, conducting water quality evaluations, as well as putting together operational maintenance metrics that we think we're going to need to run the system anyway. So those are things that we're currently moving forward with. We've also submitted to them a draft operation and maintenance plan And we've worked tirelessly in the last- I want to say, 18 months doing flow monitoring, data collection to expand our hydraulic model, So the hydraulic model that Alka-Sand used to do their wet water planning. the city Pittsburgh Water has expanded that to a much higher level of detail to help us understand the sewer capacity within the system. So that work is still ongoing, even as we speak. Next slide. So some of the things that we're keeping in mind as guiding principles. even though work has been suspended, we're thinking that we still need to maintain the existing infrastructure. That responsibility doesn't go away. We still need to work with people who have either flooding issues, whether they be basement flooding or overland, To the extent that those are reported to us through the right channel. Pittsburgh Water will still do the investigation to confirm where the problem is. Next slide, Next slide. So we'll continue through the same thing. Anybody who's running anaffles without permission, who are impacted with the projects in question, are still trying to figure out best ways to go out and do community meetings and bring them up to speed what's going on and continue to maintain that two-way communication. so it doesn't look like we kind of ran away. But at least the problem with things like that is when there's a void of information, people will fill it in with the wrong information and that's what we don't want to have happen. So projects that are moving forward: the Southside Flats sewer separation, the other one, the next one: we have partner projects with the Pittsburgh Rapid Transit folks that we regional transit- sorry, We have projects with them as well as PennDOT. We've partnered with PennDOT with putting up the funds. They actually have put together the projects and the contractor to do some of the stream restoration to help us with our permit. The Woods Run Phase Two: AlkaSan is helping us with the growth funding on that one. so that project is. the intent is to move forward with the construction of it- MS4 compliance ones. those are the two sites We are on the same permit with the city and those two sites are currently under construction: Glass Run and Shortier's Creek. And, like I mentioned earlier, we're completing design on the and, like I mentioned earlier, we're completing design on the Oak Ridge project and Fowler Park. Fowler Park is a phase one over raw analysis that we're doing to see how whatever the projects that we come up with can still work for the park locally as well as help bring extra storm water to that park from the neighboring impervious areas Next slide. So the main reason we're thinking the things that cause the project to grow. So the main reason we're thinking the things that cause the project to grow. So the main reason we're thinking the things that cause the project to grow, the biggest one really is the funding side of it. And then there are also permitting challenges And, as most of you know, post COVID there's been a lot of escalation of construction costs and those continue to, where we have to consistently look at effectiveness of our project designs, look at ways to cut costs, if you will, moving forward with those projects. The other thing- that is the other thing that is helping us or we're thinking we're gonna look at, is: how do these projects fit in with the wet water plan that we need to do for CSO control? How do those dovetail? How does it fit in with any of our storm water strategic planning that we've already done, as well as our wet water program that they're doing under their consent decree? So that's another aspect that we're continuing to look at. even though it feels like everything is stopped, there's still work being done. even though it feels like everything is stopped. even though it feels like everything is stopped, there's still work being done behind the scenes. There's still work being done behind the scenes. There's still work being done behind the scenes. Next slide: They want one of the projects that has been front and center obviously is a four mile run project. We may go through during the Q&A we might handle some additional information on that, but right now just to say that the project is at 90% design. a lot of the environmental green infrastructure type of things were removed for various reasons. type of things were removed for various reasons. type of things were removed for various reasons that we won't go into at this point. But this is basically now a storm water only project with the intent of addressing flooding, typically like a 10 year flood was the design for that. We're looking very closely at constructability analysis. There's a lot of when you think about what we're doing with the tunneling. we're going under an old railroad bridge, going through Greenfield Avenue, which is very, very crowded, and then we're running into a lot of obstacles on Second Avenue. Some of it are Verizon conduits and things like that that may need to be moved in the process. So we're making sure that a lot of these things are taken care of, looked at before we go to final design and actually bid it, so we don't get in trouble with change orders and things like that. The one thing that has hampered us is, once those environmental and friendly parts of the project were kind of removed, You reduce the CSO overflow, which is the metric that AlkaSand uses to give the funding. So it brought us below the funding threshold of the 10 million. So AlkaSand has temporarily eliminated that for now. They're still asking us, once we finish the design, to come back and see if something can be remedied. We're not sure any of that will happen, But it's still a door that they've left open for conversation. But the projects have been completed within that four mile run region, The early action projects that were done on the bridle pad. that has been very effective from what I understand from the people who live very close to that area. The second thing that we think may actually be very impactful- but we don't know the extent of the impact- is the reconstruction of the M-29 outfall. There was a gate like a five foot high gate that was blocking, that was used to keep flow the river out of this sewer system. That gate has been removed and now has a flap gate which acts differently from a hydraulic standpoint. So one of the things we're thinking. and then a lot of debris was also removed because you have a gate like that. it slows down flows, drops out a lot of stuff in the sewer, So we've also removed a lot of debris when that project is constructed. So we're having one of our M-29 outfalls, having one of our hydraulic engineers go to and do some evaluation now to look at to see if that improved anything. fortunately we haven't had really drastic storms since that project was completed, so we can judge by a level of flooding that has happened to date. but we want to do a hydraulic evaluation just to confirm if our suspicions are correct. so that's underway as we speak. so looking forward the thought process and approaches to seek more grant funding. again, we don't know how, how these going to play out, but it's something that we are trying to look forward to doing and identifying any intermediary measures that we can. so, for example, just that evaluation i was talking about with the four mile run project and then working collaboratively with the council offices or anybody else that will have us to help beat the bushes, as they say, and see if we can come up with any kind of funding that will be helpful in the projects that we plan to do. next, and i think this is the questions, and yeah, thank you. so we've also been joined by councilwoman strassberger. does anyone else have anything they'd like to say before? i can't see any more questions. so we're gonna have to wait for the next one. so we're gonna have to wait for the next one. so we're gonna have to wait for the next one. so we're gonna have to wait for the next one. so we're gonna have to wait for the next one. turn it over to members. no, okay, great, well, i'll. councilman charlin, let's go first. you know i i don't really have anything specific because i think most of the presentation was about the four mile run projects. like i said i i am concerned about the projects in south side. i would like to have another discussion about that at some point in the future. but nothing, nothing more, for for today. you know, and i appreciate your ability to to juggle, as things from the federal government change dramatically and you have to react accordingly. so, but thank you, i appreciate it. thank you, councilman. well, i apologize and regret that another meeting kept me from from coming to see the presentation. i, as a board member, i have been briefed on this project and the trajectory it's taken, so i'm not unfamiliar. i guess my only question would be: is there anything that this that you think the city can do, as we have a a whole wide, not just on this project, but we have a whole sort of city-wide storm water management plan? is there any more that the city can do to partner, to assist, to help to achieve the same goals that we all have, which is a reduction in flooding, better quality of life for neighborhoods, procedures likething, storeeez and budget and ungefähr? thank you, new zone credit stock eerily. yes, we haven't kept in mind yet- umSenator mistakes origin, say, the south side park project on hold. so i think what we had talked about was trying to figure out the types of mitigations that we could do. we could do as part of the project, like in phases, and work kind of closely with with dpw to see where there were opportunities where the projects could kind of mesh up. one of the things that friends of south side park would like to bring forward is the playground that is within the portion of south side park that i think is like right off of arlington boulevard, at the top near the football field. so there's a playground that they have planned to build there and so that's something that they would like to move forward. so i think it sounded as though there was an opportunity to look at, look at the possibility of phasing. so where we could find opportunities to work with dpw to phase, i think would be useful. does that leverage funds in a particularly strategic way? sometimes maybe it's project dependent. okay, yeah, i think that we would need to look at the capital program to see where we would have opportunities to leverage anything. no, i'm interested in kind of hearing the the back and forth between the chair of this, this post agenda and pittsburgh water representative. so i'll leave my questions at that for now. yeah, thanks. so i guess my first question just to summarize again for folks: so what are the projects that are paused? the list of projects that are paused? we had a list the the major ones were the stewart avenue project for my run and i'm trying to go by up to top of my head. do we have it on there? i'm sorry, i'm okay, i'm okay. yeah, i'm okay. we've already met with the gardeners and there's one other one that escapes me now: south side park. so there's four, four projects altogether. so i'm obviously very familiar with the four mile run- yes, four mile run. so i'm very familiar with the flooding impacts in that neighborhood. what are the flooding impacts in the other three that have been put on pause? they the stewart avenue. one for sure is the flooding. it's similar problems. there was some road. they had swells in the system before and then there was some road repairs that were done that basically eliminated that efficient way of getting the storm water out and that resulted in some localized flooding that we're also the plan was to alleviate with the new project and for that one does that affect. are there residents that are affected by that one? so it's similar like oh yeah, but it's not the same level. the four mile run one is fairly specific because it's more like a bowl area down by big jams. most of those are up a little higher, but it just it doesn't convey the water out efficiently enough, so it backs up on the streets and also, some of them, impacts their homes. okay, and then what about mlk field and south side park? what? what happens there when it floods? mlk field primarily- i mean south side park primarily- is a cso program, so i'm not sure it's so much a flooding issue. mlk, i'm not sure. mlk field was primarily looking at how we could retain water, and so the construction, the construction or the design plans were to install retention basins beneath a portion of the field and- and the main concerns- there was proper coordination with the gardeners so that their, so that their growing season would not be as as impacted by our water supply, and so it's a great thing to be able to do. but we were really looking at trying to retain, retain and hold back water. oh, i see, okay, so those were not like flood, like flood issues per se. it was more. okay, so i guess- and i'll ask some questions- that i also that i do know some of the answers to. 19 was the last very bad flood. Yes, No, it was a 2020, That's right. 21 was the last one we had a picture of, So 2021? Yeah, And just for anyone listening you know in the run and correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is that it is that when you get a very heavy rain, the water in the sewers comes down from Greenfield right And it overwhelms the pipes And what we get are manhole covers blowing off and literally the entire neighborhood from Acorn Street down to the playground and four mile run road filling with sewage. And we have a lot of folks who live there And you know it's not. It's not a great situation, right, And it depends on how long the rain lasts, but basically it fills up, So it's like a lake, And then, once the rain stops, it drains. It takes relatively- I mean maybe 15, 20 minutes, something like that, for it to drain out, But we have had incidences. There was- I can't remember what year this was, but it happens very quickly- Yes, So one year, For example, there were customers coming out of big gyms and a man and his son had to scramble and to the top of their car and the fire department had to come And in fact, the fire department had a hard time reaching them because it was like they were out, sort of stuck in this lake. That is what happens there. So, yeah, So you know this is sort of had a long history And I think it's really important that we agree with the neighborhood in this project. And obviously, just, you know This project for a number of years, for about six years was tied- at least the permits right. We're tied to the Mon Oakland Connector Project And you know the understanding from the community which you know is even now, even that I'm on counseling, I have a little bit more of an understanding of, like you know, the community, Like how things work and whatnot. I still am not. you know, I'm still a little on the side of the conspiracy side of. you know, back in 2015 the city announced this project to build a road: 26 million was the original budget, over five, you know, over the years- for this project to build this road through Shenley Park and through 4 Mile Run And this project was really really close. It was 16 channel bundled to connect the universities in Oakland to a new development at the Hazelwood Green And of course, the residents and the run were beside themselves that this project was happening but their storm water project was not happening. And that you know that the city, of course, like we're all lumped in together, right, PWC of the city, right, It's all taxpayer money, but that somehow there was money to build this road for the universities and the development next door But there was no money to fix this flooding problem. That's right. And then, just having, you know, the new public building now Bye-bye to the people over the time- And I think that wasn't part of the if- six- Chandler's upgrading, memorize the re. could you and Jay, Do you have back-share with you this flooding problem that had been going on? i mean, this is a community where people are, you know, replacing their boilers over and over again, just constant flooding. and so folks were upset and then, through the course of the six years where they, where residents, fought the city over the road, you know, then it was like, oh well, we're gonna do the project, the flood project, but it was tied to the road and residents felt again. i said and, and i felt at the time. i mean, i'm still a resident, but at the time i was, you know, just a just a neighbor- felt that folks in the run were being that they're, they're sort of that their flood project was sort of being held hostage, so to speak, by this road. that it was either like either you just shut up and accept this road or you just shut up and accept this road, and then you know, i mean- and i think that's something that i think that i've seen a lot of people have been doing in the community and i'm sure you've seen a lot of people have been doing that- and i think that's something that i think is really important to be able to see- is that you know you don't have to do it on the road if you want to get your flood project done or you don't get your flooding right. like you know it's, it's both and and in the permitting plans. i know this is painful, i know this is like this is a long, you know, but you know, over the and then and then you know, and then in the permitting you know it was very clear that the road was part of the permit for the flood right and so sort of underscoring this theory that it was like it was like either you get, either you do this road that the city wants or you don't get your flooding. and you know the residents pushed back on that and pushed back on those permits. and you know lots of, lots of community organizing was done around that and finally, finally, after six years, right, we got a new mayor and that mayor, who had come down and you know, made this promise to us to stop this road project, kept his word, stopped the road project and then now, lo and behold, the flood project is cancelled as well. so you can understand the line that is drawn between those two things. so you know, and i understand, that i i don't have, you know, i'm not on the pwsa board. i don't have control over what is done, what isn't done, so i can just ask questions about you know, from from residents. so, in terms of you know what's happening now in the run, like you know, i understand that there was some work done on the bridle path. i will say that since 2021, they're still like when we get a heavy rain, there is flooding, but it comes out of Shenley, but it's not. it's not necessarily coming up out of the sewage. That's not what's happening, but we are still absolutely getting tons of mud that comes down from Shenley park, like down the zigzag trail, So that you know, I mean it's a heavy rain, It's like that whole section going into Panther hollow is just covered in mud, The playground is covered in mud. So you know, I don't, I don't know if I would say that the, that the projects up on the bridle trail are necessarily. I mean, I don't know again if those projects were intended to do, but but that is certainly still an issue I I've had, you know, working with Rachel ramp, you know I will say very responsive. you know, when I call and say, Hey, we've had a big storm, like can someone come down the run and like clean out these storm drains and whatnot. So So I do appreciate that. but I guess you know, just to kind of start off, you know with the question, So so you know, one one thing that came up is sort of you know what's the difference between then and now, like what you know? you mentioned that you know the Alka sand project may help, like the, you know the, The M 29 outfall may have an impact. So I want to let you all talk a little bit about that. So what is it that brought you to the place, aside from funding, right Aside from funding, brought you to the place of like, we don't need or or or. this is not urgent, as urgent as the other flood projects that are still moving forward, I mean, the only it's. it's really funding. Yeah, honestly, it's really funding. the designing and the planning was moving along those lines even with the Alka sand project, but it's really the funding for the construction of the. So so why do we know, why can you explain why Alka sand pulled the 10 million Cause? I know that the permits changed. I'll let, I'll let you talk a little bit about that Sort of the, the, what happened with the permit, And I've, I've, I've heard this, but I'll let you go into. So, the, the. I never can tell what the acronym grow means: Greening out the grow project. They have a program where they fund reduction of storm water in the into the system, especially that storm water is shown to reduce the amount of combined sewer overflow that actually ends up in the streams. So when we did the initial analysis, it demonstrated that We're more than 20 million gallons- maybe closer to 30 million gallons- a year of combined sewer overflow that was reduced from the rivers by doing the daylighting portion that the Mon Oakland roadway would have been part of. So, if we're daylighted, the stream deepen the Pantaholo lake and dam and did all of those projects it would have resulted in, plus the storm sewer, It would have resulted in north of 20, 29 million gallons a year of combined sewer overflow And, based on the analysis, that we're able to say, okay, this makes sense for us to fund as part of those projects. When we took that part of the project out in order to move forward, it basically left us with just a storm sewer, and storm sewers, by definition, don't really reduce that much CSO because they don't start, They don't kick in Mm-hmm Until, like you know, two inches, three inches of rain. What they were looking at was 24 hour stream Mm-hmm. Right, That was going into their system. We were going to take that out. Now that's still going into the system and we don't. we don't have the reduction, So it didn't. we were not able to show up to 20 million gallons a year of CSO combined sewer overflow reduced. So, so again, and I was very familiar with those permits, right, I, you know at the time, The one thing I had to say to the people that I know that that was in the first year was in 2018. the road going away had no impact, as far as I could tell, on, I mean, and and the original plan was daylight the stream right. So along the railroad track on the soccer field there would have been a daylit stream. you know that you, the, the, the run right Would have been daylit and then you know. so why couldn't that be done? I mean, the road went away, but that didn't. that was a separate The. the road going away Would have increased the cost Of the car data cost of the project in the sense that we're sharing back filling, so we're moving dirt from one to the other to help with the backfill. so the road going away increased the cost. but that wasn't the only reason. the other reason was the getting permitting from the state. on the actual daylighted street. there were a lot of technical differences of opinion. the state didn't like the approach we were using and the way they were recommending that we do it. it came down: should you have a liner under that stream or not? we thought you needed a liner. if you have a liner, you can maintain the water. state says: no, we don't want a liner. if you take the liner out, the water is going to disappear. you're just going to have a dry channel. so that was, that was another point of technical difference. and then the final one was at the at the lake point. the dam that holds the lake back right now is sitting on the right of way for the railroad, okay, and so the railroad gets involved. railroad says no, we're not going to give you guys a permit, some we you can't. once you start moving the dirt there, you have to get it totally off our right of way. and that was the third and final piece that there was no way we could do all those, meet all those different requirements within the timeline. we thought we needed to do that, to do the project between the railroad and getting the, the state to work out the liner issue, and then, with the roadway going away, those three pieces. basically, we said, okay, what can we do? that still would help flooding the still. and the consensus was we could still look at the storm sewer piece and just concentrate on that. once we made that decision, the 10 million dollars which would be enough to make sure that we got that water back to the system, and we could do it with the rain, because we could have used that more for the rain and we could have used it for water and we could have used it for the rain. so it wasn't upfront money. we paid pittsburgh water, would have paid it up front and then got a reimbursement from our person. so, i guess, explain to me more about the liner. why couldn't we do, why couldn't we just update it and do it the way the state? if you thought we should do it, the amount of water that's coming off gonna fill it's, gonna go over a spillway and all of that water was gonna end up in this channel right all the way down, and that was a nice way to channel it. but when there's no rain, there was a continuous amount of stream that would be going through that channel, but it's very slow flow, so barely where you probably couldn't see it. if you don't have a liner, you'll be dry, you'll just infiltrate into the ground and you wouldn't see it, and so it'll be a dry bed pretty soon. all the stumps, tree stumps they were gonna put in out, all of that would die and it would actually be more of an eyesore. then it would be a living stream, which was the intention. so that difference of opinion in technical approach basically said you couldn't do the dry bed, okay, and then explain to me about the railroad because I thought that had to do with Panther Hollow Lake. yeah, it had to do with the lake being deepened and to do it we had to move the embankment, which the state considered a dam, and the toe of that dam. we don't have a map, but if you looked at the map, the way it is now, the current spillway and and the toe of the dam is right on railroad, right away, something you probably could have done in the 40s and 50s or whenever the dam was built, but you couldn't do that. so which railroad is it that was not? yeah, I have to find. like, was it CSX? yes, yes, it was CSX, yes, so, just so I'm clear, what did CSX say we couldn't do? we have we would have to get the spillway off the right-of-way and we would have to move the embankment, the dam, off the right-of-way, which means we'll have to push all that back off the right-of-way. when you say back, you mean like toward the lake, yes, towards where the lake is not the right-of-way. so there's a whole lake down the right-of-way and that whole embankment would have to be pushed down the right-of-way and the spillway would have to be located off the right-of-way, and would that have been then connected to the stream sitting here right now I'm not even sure. just, it would be the. everything I just described just adds again, you just keep adding to the cost of the project. so I'm still not totally clear. so this issue with the stream, you with the liner, okay, so let's just say like, was this a? i don't understand the 10 million dollar difference like, so we lost 10 million dollars because we took away the green infrastructure. that would have happened next, you know, along the soccer field, right along. yes, the 10 million dollars we were getting for the performance of the project, right, and the performance would have was the, the performance was there when you had the store, the, the green infrastructure, elements of it that would, that were like, yes, everything was there. once that went away, you rerun the models and you do the analysis. you don't. you don't get the performance you get from a combined cerebral flow reduction, not a flooding. the flooding remediation didn't change right. but what i'm asking is: so i, i understand about the lake, i understand that, like shifting panther hollow lake, you know, know, whatever, like 10 feet or yeah, whatever it would have had to have been. i get that, that is, you know, complicated, and moving the dam or whatever, but but the stream, i still don't understand. so, okay, there's, the state says no liner. you say there should be a liner. yes, that seems overcomable. i mean, we can ask our army corps folks. i don't know if you have any thoughts on liner versus no liner. it depends on the intention for the stream. yes, yeah, i mean it. yes, the. the intention was to have a stream, to have a stream flow, right, yeah, i remember, and it was going to be like, yeah, it was going to be and it was going to be nice, right, yeah, right, and the only way that was going to happen would be if the water didn't disappear on the underground and then you have a dry bed. that was the the fear was for, because if not, the water would have been gone and the water would have been gone. so i think it's a great question, because if you could have a dry bed and if you could have a dry bed, and if you could have a dry bed, then if you have a dry bed, then all the root balls and all of those nice looking features that you, we were going to put in, all of that would be dead within the matter of, you know, year and a half, right, and then you have to go dig it all up. you basically have an open channel swale. well, so again, i mean, and that's sort of what i'm thinking is, why could that? i mean, if it's again like the aesthetics aside, right, yes, forget about that part. but if just along the railroad track, on the on the park side, if you just said, oh, you know, if i'm using the boulevard track to transfer the dirty on slide, it would help the pasta roller, right, if i didn't know what was going on, yeah, i mean. okay, i guess, again, if i got a lot of heads, what would that mean? so that's what i mean. yeah, of our, you know, route had a large, you know, i don't know, fill it with- again, i'm not an engineer- it would have been a large swale, that would have been. basically, the issue is the original intent wouldn't have been met and at that time- i don't know if people would remember this, but that was one of the hits- Pittsburgh Water was Blank water was taken. was we do we give? I do preserve this nice graphic. it green infrastructure's beautiful when it works and you get it at the peak time, but when it's dry season- or I always you know it's because it's off season- it doesn't look nice to a lot of people And we were getting complaints from people how these things look nice and it doesn't look like the pictures you showed us. And so the risk of doing one of these where the dry beds would also be empty and all the other stuff it was like. at this point let's put that aside and concentrate on the storm sewer. It was really more an expediency type thing. Let's go with this storm sewer and see if we can get that design and build. Okay. so taking that out, I mean whether and the aesthetic part, I mean the issue is the flooding right, Like that's the issue for the folks in the round. If there was sort of an ugly, you know whatever, catch basin or something along the edge of the, I don't think that. I mean obviously something so people don't fall in it, but other than that, I don't imagine that that would have been an issue. So So we don't do that and we lose 10 million on the overall project. Would that 10 million allow us to do the stuff, the gray infrastructure. So the 10 million- the reason I here for us to focus on it, the 10 million- is money we get reimbursed. So that money is money Pittsburgh Water spends Upfront regardless. Okay, So you get, you get some of it back, Great. so that was not. it wasn't a deal breaker as such, It was just. it was just. all we're doing was listing out all the things that happened sequentially, that the money went away. Of course it helps. You can't. if you can get 10 million, you take it well. so with the 10 million from Alka San, I mean, would that have been 10 million for the whole project, including the gray, or would it Only have been allowed to be used for the, for the green infrastructure? It would have been for the total project. The way it was done, It wasn't a good because the total project was evaluated. So you, you do it. you, evaluating the green infrastructure part and the storm sewer part, and both combined, gave you a performance that warranted the 10 million. The green infrastructure off the table. the performance didn't warrant that. So again, I mean, I'm Coming back to: can you just do this green infrastructure? So what? well, how short. are we on budget Cause I, I can't remember It changed a lot. Like is I some? it was like I don't even remember. It's been so many years, Like it was like 20 million or 40, but like how, how, how many millions of dollars were allocated to this project originally, And then where did that change? How did that change along the road? Maybe that's a question for Jen. Yeah, So right now in our budget we have enough. We have enough to complete the design. as far as construction dollars are concerned, I'm kind of in the same boat You are. I thought that the construction was upwards of 30 million. Yes, and so that's where our Delta lies right now. Currently, we're spending 30- 30 million in our CIP for stormwater improvements around the city, but we don't have that additional 30 million to be able to do this construction. But what happened in the meantime? Because I mean, I mean, we were again this, This is years ago, but community meeting after community meeting, we were told that the money was there, that the project was happening. What happened to the money? Because our priorities shifted to some of those mandated projects that we spoke about earlier. So the water reliability plan, which has- it's a kind of a Rubik's cube of projects that need to happen so that we can get to that clear Well, the clear what was a hundred year old structure. It's a single point of failure in our system and we must address it and so to do a number of these projects, even the, You know, building of the Highland pump station, had to happen before we could then get to that clear Well. so there's a number of projects, You know, I think we put up there 470 million that need to go towards these projects, And I don't even believe that includes the clear well costs as well. But I mean, isn't there also a mandate that we, that we separate our sewage and our and our regular water so that we don't have sewage going into our, Our sewage? We're still, we're still communicating that stream goin forward, Yeah, Yeah, And also our son's dad, Mm, we're still taking the materials that we came out, know their, their, Yeah, Between the units of. but the answer, but the answer to the question there is: we continue to multiply people to have higher And we're still corrupt. for the last, We're still -huh, We're still negotiating that. so German government, So that has not, So that has not been signed formally to, meant to have us, to have us to combine your, have us to combine your grow work. That that was just moved out of this project over whenever. when was that money moved? a number of years ago, this, this current budget cycle, so 24 for 25- was when we needed to make some really hard decisions and move money away from certain projects. yes, okay, so that was. is that when you all sent the letter or was that? yeah, we sent the letter. I believe it was two months, end of February. yes, to alert community members and other stakeholders of our intentions. the estimated project costs also have increased over time. Tony can speak to that too. the cost of the estimated costs have also increased, as you mentioned earlier, sure? I mean, it's been a lot of years that the project didn't get done. so how much money has PW, say, spent so far on this project? this project, I think, whenever we look at the final numbers. but the last set of numbers that I had was in the neighborhood of 8. 7 million dollars give or take, and that includes the half a million dollars for the construction that I was talking about for the bridal. it has a. it has been the all the different planning and final designs that we've done today, so 8. 7 million has been spent. so on a project. that what, what's the current estimate to do the whole, to do the project, 30 million for the for the construction piece, mm-hmm- yes, I'm sorry, I'm just looking so it was 40. okay, so it was 40 million. that was what was allocated all together, including the design. and what would it cost if we were to add back in just this, this, you know, daylighting of the stream just along, I mean taking out the bells and whistles of you know whatever beautification stuff. but just to do, just to do the daylighting, that mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, it's a problem. I can give you a number but it's a real problematic number. the number we had initially was in the neighborhood of five million dollars for that piece. the reason is a problematic number is it's a number that was not approved by any of the agencies. so we don't know what level of effort would need to be done to get them to approve anything, or even to get, if we have to do stuff with CSX to get them to sign off. so that's hard to estimate. mm-hmm, okay, so you mentioned earlier that we have had, so we have not had any big. so I mean I will. I'll say again, since 2021, we have not had one of these mega floods in the run. yes, we've had, we've had live ideas come down from the park, but we have not had. so have we not had a storm that would have recalled that? because we just haven't had had the. it wasn't just having the rain is having the rain that centered over the run. we haven't had that to be able to say. but, like i'm saying what, that's part of the reason we started doing the evaluation, because we can, in a hydraulic model, you can artificially set those storms in place and then ask the question: how vitally would it have flooded? so that's part of the analysis we're doing to see if that those changes actually helped them. we didn't know. so i mean what? because, see, that's the thing is. so for folks down there, right, like my neighbors, i mean you can, you can see when you lay out the, the history of the thing they basically feel like. you know they didn't back down on the road that the mayor wanted to. the mayor at the time wanted to build through a public park. right for a road, for for private shuttles to run through a public park and their community right. so what? they were fighting, just to be clear, was not having those upmc and or not you can, i shouldn't say that, you know, but whatever, like those shuttles that you see in oakland running through, right through their neighborhood every you know 10 minutes or whatever it was going to be, and then also through their park where people bike and play soccer and etc. right, and because they fought that and said no, that this, you know that it was decided then that they just didn't get their flooding right. they were mad that they- i just i just want to make that clear and i feel like that is, and i get that there's sort of like the idea that there's not a conspiracy, but it sure feels like a conspiracy, right, if you're, if, if you're living down there and you say my city doesn't care about me, right, like my pittsburgh water that i pay lots of money to every month for my water doesn't care about me. so what, what can we offer? right, like, what can we do if we get another big rain? i mean, can we offer to pay to replace people's boilers? what can we do? can we offer to put backflow valves in people's basements? like you know, we've got 400 and 430 000 left on design: 432 000 of 8. 7 million that has been spent before. it would be possible to have an option for about a hundred thousand people. what do you think that's something we would have to look into? it's, yeah, that's something we would have to look into. it's not something i can give you any answer on right here, but i promise to take that back and and take a look at that for you what some options could be. i mean, is there any? you know we have a field down there. we have all. i mean, again, i'm just something between everything and nothing, right? I don't know, I don't know the Army Corps. do you guys have any thoughts overall? I don't know how familiar you are with this project and this area. Thank you. We're pretty familiar with Four Mile Run. We've been approached a couple of times to look at projects there. Section 219 program at one point in Section 219 is our environmental infrastructure program. It allows us to deal with water and storm water infrastructure- And a Section 206 program, which is- I'm just spitting out numbers to you, but those are sections of our Water Resource Development Acts that allow us to provide assistance. So Section 206 is an ecosystem restoration continuing authority. So we have programs to help The Environmental Infrastructure Program. there are two that Allegheny County as a whole has available to it. It's the Section 219, as I mentioned earlier, and Section 313. The difference between the two is that Section 219 is more of a turnkey type program where a municipality would come to us and we would do the design or the construction. Section 313 is remote. It's reimbursable, which that allows the local municipality or the utility to do the work, And then we would reimburse them a portion of that. Both of those programs are 75% federal contribution, And so what that means is for every dollar that an entity would spend, we would reimburse 75 cents of that. We've worked with the Monn Water group, which is a four mile run, And so we've tried to put together a regional watershed group with watersheds of South Pittsburgh to discuss the different storm water issues in the city of Pittsburgh. We've moved that through with our planning assistance to states program. That's a technical assistance program. We also have different cap authorities in the latest WERDA, and each of those are in the state, And the latest WERDA, WERDA 2024, which will help us deal with storm water, And it also, I believe, allows for reimbursement for what we would call a non-federal sponsor to do the project. So I think that we have a number of tools that would benefit entities looking to take advantage of them. So I mean, is that up to the Monn Water? I mean the Monn Water project being a one person trying to start versus? so what can PWSA do? Because I don't wanna put this on the Monn Water project? Oh no, it's certainly not. It is not their responsibility. I've just I made mention of that just to say that we're Sure, sure. no, I get it. Okay, yeah, That person does a lot, Yes, that person does a lot. So it would simply be PWSA coming to the Corps of Engineers and putting in a letter of intent saying we'd like to partner with the Corps of Engineers and working with us to resolve this issue, And then we would be able to seek funding. I would recommend that the elected representatives be involved as well, just to let them know that the federal government is involved. While we have the programs available, the elected representatives are responsible for the funding. The other question I have is: so PennDOT is also and we don't know yet what the project will entail, whether it's a rehabilitation or a replacement. See, it's just the run. I mean, we just sort of get it from all sides. But 376 is crumbling and falling pieces of it are falling on the folks who live down in the run, but that's, of course, a major project. So has there been any communication with PennDOT about ways that that project, which obviously you know lots and lots of money being put into that, could also help to address? The communication we've had with them has been through their public involvement sessions that they've held that have come. That's basically to the extent we've had it to now and they're still working through their preliminary design to get a sense of how much the flow rates are gonna change from what they had before. And that was the conversation, the extent of the conversation. Last time we tried very early in the process to get them involved- this would have been 2021, 22. having a meeting with them, The pushback from them was that they didn't have any money themselves. They didn't have any money themselves to add to it. So that was their story at that time. But now we're just looking to make sure if the flows are increasing in any way then it won't be a question of you don't have any monies. how much can you actually work with us? I mean, I'm just sort of wondering even just the field, right, We call it the big Jim's field, It's called Four Mile Run Park, right, That is city, not all of it, but much of it is city property And that's sort of like the center of the lake that forms If there's anything that can be done even just under that. I mean, I know, you know I'm not trying to oversimplify things, but I mean there've been alternatives that have been considered before, but I think a lot of it just focused on the storm sewer for now, but it may be time to. That's what I mean. I mean that's it. It's like: is there money to do So? I, you know so 30, 40 million, whatever was moved to other projects, but is there money? that can you know? I mean, maybe, maybe, I don't know, just something that when the water, or should the water start coming up out of you know, when the storm drains blow off, can we put something on the sides of the? I mean again, I'm not the engineer, right, But so that water does not just rise and create a lake. That's right. Anyway, I just so. you know, there's definitely frustration And I know that and I appreciate that you all are gonna come down to the run. It's not gonna be a fun meeting for anybody, But I would, I guess, my, you know, all I can do is ask questions, unfortunately. I wish that there was more that I could do. I guess I can reach out. you know I have a board member here. I would like to see some of this money, I mean, you know, money that was moved to go back to doing something rather than nothing. right, Because that just doesn't feel, it doesn't feel fair And it doesn't feel right. right, Like you know, this is a neighborhood And hopefully you know we don't have. but also, I would like you know, my recommendation would be, before you come to the neighborhood, before you come and sort of have this conversation without answers, with the community to do some of these things right, Like run your model, Like does, has- I mean, that's what I've been sort of wondering this whole time- Has the, does the M-29 did that kind of fix it right? Is that part of it? Or is it just that we haven't had the rain? That's absolutely the intention. That's the intention for the public meeting. Yeah, To have that resolved first before. And also acknowledge, you know, and maybe come with some idea, because you know, again, the mud and that is not sewage overflow, That's just mud coming down from Shenley Park. And we have houses along Naylor. I mean, I know for a fact that some of the residents, or at least one of the residents on Naylor, has filed a claim with the city of Pittsburgh because of all the debris and whatnot that comes down into their, onto their property and is ruining their basement just constantly out of Shenley Park, right, Because Naylor's right on the back there. So you know, come with some type of solutions for that. We have lots of that's. the thing about the run is we have all I mean in terms of green infrastructure, and I don't know, you know, I know that. you know, maybe green infrastructure isn't as effective as everyone wishes that it were, I don't know. But we have lots of places in the run where there's just a big wide area with nothing in it, right. So, and you know, and we have streets and whatever, We don't have major parking issues on our main streets, you know. so just to come with some ideas to the community, I mean, I would love for you to come to the community and say we voted to give the money back and we're just gonna do the flood mitigation project, But not if the you know not if the M29 did the trick, Right? Yeah, Oh, yeah, You know not if the big Alka-San, what's it called? It was the big dig in Boston, I think, was it? what are we calling it? Tunnels, Whatever the right? Yeah, I mean again, anyway, I just if there's anything else that anyone, any last thoughts I mean, other than the analysis that we're talking about making sure to have those runs, and then the questions that you've, provided that we have a sense of what those answers will be before the community meeting. Yeah, That, from our side of it too, that was part of the hope of this, to get some of that early warning. Yeah, I mean just cause they will, you know, I mean just to keep in mind. you know, around the city we've got, you know, we've got little intersections in Squirrel Hill and Point Breeze that have like full on stormwater management on just a tiny little intersection right, Like storm. It looks like a million dollars infrastructure, maybe, you know, maybe three quarters of a million dollars of infrastructure, just on one little, one tiny little cross street right, But the run has giant flooding and they have nothing. So, anyway, I'll leave it at that. Yes, Thank you. Well, I want to thank everyone for being here today And I, as a as a member of the board of Pittsburgh Water, I have been party to the conversations that and the extreme heartburn that has taken place when asking these exact same questions. Can't we? you know, this has been a perennial issue. Residents in the run have suffered. Is there anything that can be done? And it's, it's, it's, it's, it's just a lose-lose situation when you have, when you're, when you're faced up against decades, nearly a century of disinvestment, You're, you have to make hard decisions when there are mandates to either repair our single point of failure infrastructure- our ABC project, Aspen Wall, Brecken and Clear Wall Project right, Which serves, like the entire customer base of Pittsburgh Water- Or other projects that residents in the run, residents in these other storm water project areas, have been waiting for for for years and years and years. It's never an easy, never an easy decision, And I've witnessed the heartburn that has taken kind of these difficult decisions, the heartburn that Pittsburgh Water employees and leadership have have experienced in having to contend with this. And I think we've all been asking the questions: Is there anything? th—it can be done? Has you know? ha- have have the interventions that have taken place done enough? What more can be done? I What I hear today, what I've heard in the year that it have led up to this, is: you know, everything that will be done, that can be done, will be done. It's just a matter of sequencing and and a matter of prioritization. And you know when you, when you're thinking about tens of thousands of customers who, anything that could happen to reduce the ability to provide clean drinking water to tens of thousands of customers, or you know a project that a lot of residents have been waiting for, and then a mandate on top of that, like, that's a hard decision but that's one that had to be made. i'm glad that there seems to be some you know some additional information that was gathered today. that's very helpful. i hope that those kind of proactive, productive conversations continue. i don't think it helps to insinuate in any way- whether it's the feeling of the public in the run or not- that there was somehow a decision that was made to punish the members, the residents of the run because of a an organizing effort. i think that that's false. i think that the fact that three other projects were also put on pause demonstrates that's false and i don't think it helps the conversation move forward. i i have only the greatest amount of respect for the leadership and the workers of pittsburgh water and i know that they are doing everything that they can to again fix decades of disinvestment that have resulted in our infrastructure kind of crumbling. at the same time, on top of increasing flooding increase, the increasing intensity of store storms because of climate change, i mean just like the run getting hit from all angles. our water infrastructure, our sewer infrastructure, our built environment, our natural environment is getting hit from all angles as well. so i just wanted to state that for the record. i also wanted to state a correction. it was stated that a mayor was elected and then the road was canceled. what happened was prior to any new mayor, prior to this current mayor being sworn in. the entire road project was defended, except for 700 000, which was then put into trails. so wanted to state that for a correction to the record. thank you very much. Yeah, so just to clarify. I understand that the folks at this table and I do not believe sort of conspired together. however, when we talk about faith in government and you have an underserved community that has been ignored and been asking for a flood mitigation project for over a decade and then another project that does not benefit them comes to their community and they fight it, saying that they want the flooding, the flood mitigation project. and then they win their fight about the road and then the flood mitigation project is taken away. that hurts people's faith in government, whether or not it was the intent or the intention. that hurts people's faith in their government because they went to meeting after meeting for years begging for this flood mitigation and then working through this flood mitigation, having to deal with this road fight and the flood fight, and told that they didn't. you know, and I mean so much heartache, but they went into just trying to get their flooding. and keep in mind I wanna say that I actually live up high on the hill on the run so I don't get flooded. I just wanna make that clear. I don't get flooded. we're good where I sit right. This is the folks who live under the bridge. They live under 376 so they have bridge falling on their head. they're having their basements flooded over and over and over again. These are, you know, people do not, that don't have money to replace their boiler every whatever right few years, are replacing their boilers every few years. They're putting sump pumps in their basement. They have dead rats in their yard, right. So when I, as their council representative, explain their disillusion with city government and our city authorities over this project, that is what I'm talking about. And you know I'm not even to be honest with you. and this thing about the budget money is absolutely because I myself personally, when I first came to council, moved a million dollars out of the Mon Oakland, out of the four mile run project. so this idea that the Mon Oakland connector was somehow defunded before I got here is inaccurate. Maybe some money was moved out of it, but the project was certainly not defunded and it certainly was not canceled until this administration canceled it. So I would, you know, I respectfully would ask that folks defer to my experience and the experience of my own, my residents, when it comes to this particular project. Anyway, I guess, going forward, I would definitely ask if Alkacan has 10 million that can go toward right reimbursement or otherwise that can go toward helping the folks in the run with their flood issues. whether that is, I don't know, green infrastructure that catches water that comes up out of the sewer, if it can't be sewer, if it can't be gray or maybe just a combination. Maybe you can expand the sewer just on saline, like between Acorn and just past Big Jim's. I don't know. again, I'm not the engineer right, But if there's something that we can do that can allow us to access this Alkacan funding, I think we should do it. If there is something that can be done to present to the Army Corps, then they can identify funding. Obviously, this flooding issue in the run has been going on for forever. So what's another couple years? I don't know, Maybe it's another flood or two. I don't know. I mean, obviously that will. I hope there isn't another flood, But if there is, boy, we're gonna hear about it, That's for sure. So I know that this has been a long, this has been difficult for a long time and I do appreciate you all And I appreciate this sort of weird transition from being just a member of the community to now being at this table and having these conversations for real, And I think that's what's really important, And I think that's what's really important is that we're not just gonna sit here and sit and talk about this. We're gonna have to be open to the public, you know, in front of the public. So thank you all for coming, And, yeah, I guess that's it. Thank you for having us. Yeah, Yeah. so, having exhausted the business of this post agenda, this meeting is adjourned. We'll see you next time. Bye, Bye, Bye.
