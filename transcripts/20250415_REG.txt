Our first registered speaker is Dr Ronald M Miller. Dr Ronald M Miller Bell Suver, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Yes, USA and Frankfurt, Deutschland. Are these global cities? Are we supposed to be a global city here? Global Intelligence Society- candidate for president 2028. Globalinformationintelligencenetworknet: I taught global societies and invented it at the University of Pittsburgh. Structor Concerns of council include local government, neighborhoods, international, city, city allies. This is consistent with Three initiatives of mine for 2028: Local, non-party government, Neighborhood elected councils and city ally and country alliances amplified. Local protests in US streets are safety negative. Local pressure to get laws changed. City council meetings are safety positive. I appreciate what the SEIU has done and is doing on that point. I am not the only one. The president. This is European Intelligence Month, which I invented in 2010. Localization is the primary function. Globalization is subordinate to that. Local government is primary. This has been my position since 2010. Consider H Wellman publication in 2024. The national government decentralization via the office of US president offers an opportunity for local government re-centralization, including in the city of Pittsburgh and across the United States. I think we can learn from Deutschland on this via the Grundesgesetz, the basic law from 1949. I am opposed completely to any form of Nazism or neo-Nazism. by the way, Article 28 ensures and enshrines local government autonomy. in Germany, Locality Frankfurt is an extremely good example. I am not the only one, I am the only one. The United States is the only one. It is a good example. It has been listed with Pittsburgh as among the most livable cities in the world, for Frankfurt and for Pittsburgh. for the United States, Frankfurt has 770,000 people. It is at the center of the EU. There are a number of hubs. One is financial, is sometimes called bank bank fort. The European central bank is there, Deutsche Bank is there. There is a hub for intelligence. There is a hub for private sector. There is a hub for the European Central Bank Communications, DE CXI, which is the interstate exchange point for Europe. The AI Center for Germany is there. Supercomputer Center, Airline Lufthansa has its headquarters there. What Frankfurt is doing, Pittsburgh can do. I think we should become more of a financial center than we are, And Frankfurt is also home to the local public sector alliance across Germany. Thank you very much. Our next registered speaker is Azasha Mennefield. Is Azasha Mennefield, with us Not seeing them online? That exhausts our list of registered speakers.

Please come to the podium, State your name and neighborhood for the record, You will have three minutes to speak. Good morning, My name is Yvonne F Brown. I live at 715 Mercer Street. That's the high rise, That's the top of Bedford. I have been coming down for a couple years complaining about us, the seniors, that are being beaten. We're the ham. I have been in the house all summer, beaten with sticks with a woman, the bad actor Rashida McKinley. that's not allowed in the building. Now, April 1st, I heard her out on the third floor- That's where I live. She's hollering, telling Freddie Day: 304, let me in, let me in. He's saying no, no, She's hollering, you won't let me in. We have citizens in the building that are afraid of her. one woman she beat down and i know she let her and i said you let her in. she said i. she says she pushed me. i pushed her back. i said: but you let her in? do you understand that this woman has had operations? she has stitches, she had staples. recita was in 7-eleven- this is the apartment- and she was getting ready to beat that woman who had all these stitches and the owner said: no, you're not going to fight her in here. i've explained that she's chased me around. when i went to the manager and said that i'm afraid. and she said: don't say that. and i said she's threatening me. she says, oh, she don't talk to me like that. put her big breasts up in the air. she don't talk to me like that. i left sad, confused and afraid for my life. she also went in and grabbed the manager by her neck and so i said to the manager: when i told you i was afraid, and that says: when you put your big breasts. she says, oh, she didn't. i said: well, why did you throw her down? why were you rolling on the floor? she's screaming: get her off of me. the manager says: i'm not hurt, i didn't hit her, i'm just holding her down. i'm explaining to you what we're living through. we live with a woman who says: as long as my mother lives in this building, i'm coming. the police said that it's arbor and our med, straight, that's run, that's letting the ball go. he says police and the magistrate fatigue is supposed to be in her hands, or someone says they're actually kin to each other. i don't know whether it is or not, but you can check and see, because he should have recruits himself. he let this woman back in the building, knowing that her daughter has beaten up people. now the mother came and was threatening me. i said to her she said you're saying something. i said i run from that thing. that's what i call her a thing. she's supposed to her and her sister's supposed to have killed the woman. i, i'm old, i don't want to be beaten up, walking around crippled because of a woman that's not allowed in the building and you won't do nothing about it. thank you, miss brown. next speaker, please. good morning. my name is pete schmidt. mexican war streets, north side 15212. i am also the western pa district leader for seiu, local 32. thank you. i just want to formally thank our council members for sponsoring and moving forward with the introduction of the expansion of the paid sick days: council member warwick, council member mosley, council member coghill, council member charlin and obviously president labelle, who's not here today, and also council members wilson and gross. i just want to formally go on record and thank you and we appreciate your support. thank you very much. good morning. i wish to address the council on the topic of homelessness and similar activities in the pittsburgh area. my name is jacob pool, formerly zoltan jacob, and i have several names because american organizations were collecting children in the 80s and 90s, next to the civilian collapse, next to ukraine and next to serbia in the 80s. i see children cycle into children's camps, changing their names and altering identities and bringing us to america thousands of kids, one by one, and that's my story. so when i see all those tents all over downtown pittsburgh and along the river in pittsburgh, that's what i see. i see children abducted by organizations who got money for every kid. child slave trade would change names and records to here and once they turned 18, people stopped receiving money for money for them and if they refused to take slave labor jobs which they were trying to be forced into, they became homeless. because they have no families, they have no name, they have nothing. it's a Nazi concentration camp, it's Nazi activity. I have scars on my body to subdue me when I was 12 years old because I said European police said this is criminal activity. and I have scars on my body because of that, because people didn't want me walking around in high school in Ligonier, Pennsylvania saying there was mass calculations from Ukraine and from Serbia during the Soviet Union collapse to the area. so the surgical scar in my head, in my body, my back, and I have no records for them to silence me when I was 12 years old. so this is real life and those homeless people all over Pittsburgh. I bet you half of them have the same story as me. they just don't know it because they went through the same process when they were three years old, four years old, five years years old, eight years old, nine years old. The only way I know is because I was in European police custody when I was 12, 11, 12 years old. They told me this. They said they showed me around and took me to apartment complexes where women were held captive with tortured ladies and tortured people. children were taken from, put into American camps, changed their names and brought us to America All the guys that was helping us. Now I'm alone. I have no family, no name, nowhere to go, struggling, and I'm no different from the thousands of homeless people that's surrounding the Pittsburgh area And that's their story: Secret surgical procedures to silence us, to change who we are, change our names. I have and you can Google me, you can ask, look at police records created around me and everything, Medical records to create this Nazi concentration camp I live in. My emails are blocked, my phone's blocked, social media blocked. I have no friends, no human contact, no family, year after year, while I'm constantly being targeted by slave labor sites operating in the Pittsburgh area trying to take me into their forced labor camps. Thank you, Thank you Next speaker, please. Hi, I'm Bernadette from Beachview. 11 months ago, Pennsylvania House passes social media rules aimed at kids, teens, kids and teens. This bill will not solve all problems with social media, but what it does do is give parents a tool to help prevent bullying and other problems associated with these platforms, Representative Brian Monroe of Bucks County said in a statement. the bill would also require you know prior social media platforms to allow users to report conduct such as threats or bullying, as well as publicize a policy to how they will respond to these reports. Monroe cited an ongoing negative impact on our youth's mental health from content found on social media and how it helps drive an increase of anxiety and depression in teens. according to the PennLivecom report, Some states- some states are enacting legislation to regulate social media and parents may request removal of their child's photos. A Brookline Facebook user, who is a local business owner, posted an obvious picture that had a child cornered to a wall for F-bombing. That's all F-bombing. I researched the family, The child is 12. Then several more posts about the little girl after they turned off comments. I would like to see Pittsburgh a safe city of zero bullying of our kids. a database that if adults see something, they can upload instead of bullying kids on social media. Also in that database, a way to share the adults who are bullying. The de-escalation trainings are outstanding. I went to the one in Sheridan. We need to have them neighborhood by neighborhood on an ongoing basis. I once was a teen picture sharer on Facebook. I was on Facebook. I was on Facebook. I was in a group of kids who I thought were committing crimes, until one of my old foster girls, now an adult, said: mama bee, you don't know what's happening to them. And she was right. We need to make Pittsburgh a safe city for our youth. We don't know the background of these kids And F-bombing. really go to the United Kingdom. They think it's cute. Have a good day.

Yeah, So I just you know, with regard to the attack on Governor Shapiro's House and on his family over the weekend: Obviously horrific attack and terrifying. I can't imagine how stressful that is for the governor and his wife and their kids. But more than that, I just wanted to note the fact that our president referred to the attacker as just some whack job, as if this was some random situation. and it wasn't and it didn't have anything to do with the fact that this is a Jewish governor and that the attack was on the first night of Passover. to sort of wave it off as just some random situation, while at the same time, you know, actively disappearing from the picture Legal residents in the United States to foreign countries under the claim that they are terrorists, with no evidence whatsoever, totally illegal and totally unconstitutional. It's just, it's very scary, And I just wanted to mention it because I know that you know we're all here at city council, we're going about our business, we're doing you know we're going through an election, et cetera, et cetera. you know what I mean And I just wanted to mention it because I know that you know we're all here at We're going through an election, et cetera, et cetera, and everyone is doing that. right, Everyone is just going about their day and going to work and doing the things that we have to do, but people are feeling it and people and it's frightening and I just want to acknowledge that, acknowledge that that is, you know, that sentiment here in Pittsburgh and all across the country, that you know that we are aware here at City Council and that we appreciate the way that everyone is feeling, and certainly you know the way that our Jewish community members are feeling, given this attack on Sunday. So that's all from me. Thank you. Thank you, Council Member. Is there anything further from members? Yes, Council Member, Strassberger, Council. thank you, Councilman Wilson, followed by Councilwoman Kale-Smith, Thank you. If I may, I'd like to register aye votes for the votes that I missed. So noted, Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Kale-Smith. Thank you, Thank you. I think this is just, I might say, half a bell on this, a lot. but there's just one thing that's interesting, which is obviously participation- and having a conversation about this is really packed with- is not relying on Generally Support all the time, But we again, I guess, just for the. I'm just wondering if we can. Council Member Warren, Was there a school day that we didn't get an existing? No, not, we didn't. people help and trying to make sure that, and there's people here locally. I mean, I know that on the national level there's a lot going on and I leave that to our congresswoman. I know that she's, you know, doing what she can on that level. but on this level, in the city of Pittsburgh, there's people missing, there's people going missing. there's things that are happening in the city of Pittsburgh on a daily basis that needs addressed by this council and by this administration, because otherwise we're focusing on things we weren't elected to do. but we can do both, but our focus should be predominantly on what's happening in the city of Pittsburgh. that's what we're elected to do and for me, I really I see kids missing all the time in the city of Pittsburgh. every week there's somebody going that you see a post that somebody has gone missing and to try to find that person. and, honestly, there's a lot to be said about what's happening in the homes of these, of our kids, and I think the more we just ignore this and just act like this is normal, the the worse, it's becoming, not better, and I think that we need to address what's happening here in Pittsburgh in terms of our young people leaving homes, missing, homes going missing. there's just a lot. I mean, it's just so much. it's it's depressing, it really is. it's depressing- of what's happening, you know, and in our neighborhoods and each and every day and in our, the homes of kids across the city of Pittsburgh, and I wish we would do more partnering with, you know, DHS and CYF and others to get resources into and and and even our, our rec centers. they should have those resources available where kids are not just in schools but places where kids can get them after school hours or a place where they can reach, you know, resources more comfortably, and I just wish we would do more with that. and I know council on work and I are talking about a couple things with schools and and doing some partnerships in the evenings and other times, but I think generally across the city of Pittsburgh it needs to be done and I'm I know in Sheridan we have there's a lot of youth crime in the community in that area- 15, 16- There's a lot for kids to do and I tell people this all the time: if having something to do was Meant that there would be safety and kids would be safe, Homewood and Sheridan would be some of the safest neighborhoods because they have some of the best Resources. and Sheridan, they have the Jasmine- I read they have this Langley's supposed to be a community-based school Which is supposed to have programs available. They have the library, they have parks, They have people doing like hope for tomorrow and the boxing program at Langley. I know there's a lot of programs in homeward because I used to partner with them and different things. But the problem is is that we set an expectation That an absence is something to do, is is it's okay to commit a crime, And what we ought to be doing is setting the bar a little bit higher for our kids, expecting a lot more for them and Trying to lead them in a better direction. And I just feel like, yes, there should be some more things for people to do. and yes, I'm eager for the Stevens school building to open. You know it has not opened and I do feel like it has been intentionally not open, delayed because it's needs so much work and And there's a. I could say a lot to that and I will say a lot. the conversation continues. I'll say a lot publicly every week, But what I'll say now is there's a lot of projects delayed in our district that would help kids and would do more for kids, But that's still not the overall answer. The answer is yes, give them some things, But let's also remember that we've got to set the bar high for our kids and teach them a little better like they do. in short, to your city, where it's. there's almost nothing for the kids to do down there except for Park in a ball field, But yet it has the highest, some of the highest, homeownership in the city of Pittsburgh, low crime, the kids Succeeding and doing well, and I think it's because they set the bar so high, so I just was. it's when the community embraces everybody. I think it's it's coming together that we need to do a little bit all over the country, all over the city of Pittsburgh. Thank you, Thanks, councilwoman. anything further from members. I think I saw council person Charlene first, followed by council and Mosley. All right, Yeah, thank you. I would like to call for a motion for a. well, I'd like to call for a motion for a public hearing on our trash situation in Pittsburgh.

Yeah, I just wanted to echo the comments of my colleagues about Unfortunate situation that happened at the governor's mansion over the weekend. I've known governor Shapiro For two decades. met him, you know, When we were much younger, when he served in the state legislature with my wife and I'm, you know, Consider him a friend. I've known his family For a long time. So my heart goes out to the governor First and foremost. but, like my colleagues said so eloquently earlier, this really underscores, You know, the unfortunate state of our current politics And it's so, very, so important that you know We can get to a point where you know We can agree without being disagreeable and work together on issues you know and come together because you know, I think, That you know it's not overreacting to start. you're being concerned about, you know, Our own safety as elected officials on every level of government. as you know, these heinous acts you know continue from, You know, what happened in Butler, PA, last summer To what happened at the governor's mansion this weekend. So I hope at some point we can get to a point where You know our public officials are not under attack And and and folks can't disagree with us and we can have robust Dialogue and debate, you know, in the true democratic spirit, without people resorting to violence. So again, you know, I, just you know- fear for the future and hope that you know these, these, this is an aberration and Not a trend. and then I also do want to wish all those who are celebrating Passover a joyous and prosperous Passover celebration as well.
