• Council members had previously hoped to use the federal funds for tiny house communities, but federal rules classify shared bathroom facilities as "congregate," making them ineligible

• Council will revisit the agreement in five weeks once federal requirements are clarified

Headline 3: Council approves $37,000 grant to investigate old sexual assault cases and create victim interview room.
Summary 3: • City Council approved a $37,000 grant from Allegheny County to help investigate old sexual assault cases and improve victim interviews

• The money comes from the 2023 National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative Grant, with Allegheny County as the main recipient and Pittsburgh police as a sub-awardee

• Grant funds will be used for:
  - $36,000 for detective overtime to investigate untested sexual assault kits
  - $1,000 to create a "soft interview room" with comfortable furniture like couches instead of sterile desks and chairs

• Police have already identified untested sexual assault kits in their property room and done some preliminary work

• Most future work will involve pulling kits, writing reports, transporting evidence to the crime lab, and conducting follow-up investigations

• The soft interview room will make it easier for victims to share their stories in a more comfortable, less intimidating environment

• Commander Laurie McCartney of Major Crimes explained this is reimbursement for work police would do anyway

• The grant is an extension of funding the county originally received in 2019
