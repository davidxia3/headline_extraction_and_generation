"I just want Colleen to be here, because Colleen is actually a survivor, a recent survivor- of breast cancer.",x
So I want to thank her for being here and for educating a lot of us on her Facebook page about some of the things she's going through.,x
"Whereas 412 Thrive was established as a nonprofit in 2020, during the COVID pandemic, by women who longed for connection with others facing breast cancer and aimed to build a supportive community for those in similar situations.",x
"And whereas 412 Thrive supports and empowers individuals affected by breast cancer or genetic mutations linked to cancer, known as Thrivers in southwestern Pennsylvania, The group is committed to making a positive impact in the lives of those who it serves.",x
"And whereas the group offers financial support for patient resources and hosts wellness events that focus on life during and after a cancer diagnosis, They are dedicated to building a supportive community where everyone feels safe, included and connected.",x
"And whereas by offering online and in-person support, monthly gatherings, educational workshops, wellness retreats, care packages, house cleaning and meals when needed, 412 Thrive is devoted to helping individuals do more than survive: They help them to thrive.",x
"And now, therefore, be it resolved that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh does hereby recognize and commend 412 Thrive for continuing to be a strong support system to make those affected by cancer feel secure.",x
"And be it further resolved that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh does hereby declare Saturday, April 12, 2025, to be 412 Thrive Day in the City of Pittsburgh.",x
"Do we have a motion to approve, So moved.",x
"Second, All those in favor say aye, Aye, Congratulations, Thank you.",x
Thank you very much.,x
Are you a little bit taller than me?,x
"A little bit, A little bit.",x
"Hi, My voice carries, so I think I think I'm good.",x
"Thank you, Okay.",x
My name is Rachel.,x
I am blessed that I do not have breast cancer.,x
"Christine, who is also on the board with me serving 412 Thrive.",x
We have been so grateful that we have not had the journey that so many of the women who are part of 412 Thrive have gone through.,x
"We are over 800 women now and we are building a capacity to do more than just one, And we are also working to build the capacity to successfully meet the needs of the many that are affected by cancer, And we are also working to raise the needs of the most vulnerable people.",x
We are working to build the capacity to help them get through the most challenging time serving 412 Thrive.,x
We have been so grateful that we have not had the journey that so many of the women who are part of 412 Thrive have gone through.,x
"We are over 800 women now in the organization who need this as previvors or as cancer survivors, who every day are worried about what's next, And it's truly an honor to work with these women, to see their strength and their resilience and what they're willing to do to help other women who have gone through such a thing, And so, with the help of folks like Christine and myself, we're trying to get the word out so that people know that these resources exist and, obviously, raise funds so that we can help get rid of such an awful, awful disease that so many have faced.",x
So thank you so much for this honor and we will continue to do as much work as possible.,x
Just say a few words.,x
My name is Colleen Bowers.,x
"I just recently had breast cancer, a year and a half ago, and successfully they took everything out.",x
"The only problem is- I just wanted to point out to people- people don't, they hear breast cancer.",x
"they had surgery, they had mammogram, you know the whole nine process, But when you have invasive it can come back and further down, even though they got everything out.",x
So I was not aware of your organization.,x
"I was not aware of your organization, But I will deeply help you in committing and trying to get the word out on top of any fundraising or anything that I can't do for you.",x
And I just wanted to point that out to them.,x
"I just wanted to say porque este spoon se"".",x
several years ago I got a call from Sue.,x
"I'll wait for Colleen to exchange information, then come up and present her proclamation Now.",x
Colleen's been through a lot in her life and she's one of those people that she shares her stories with people.,x
A lot of us don't like to share things.,x
A lot of us like to keep things to ourselves.,x
Colleen not only shares her stories but she raises money for people that are fighting some of the things like breast cancer awareness centers for victims.,x
Her daughter was killed in a domestic violence situation and since then she has been raising money for centers for victims and for women and domestic violence survivors period across Allegheny County And she just between that and battling cancer.,x
"she has just been an amazing human being And she's involved in all the Irish stuff, which is why the AOH is that what it is.",x
AOH is here as well.,x
So I mean she's got a lot of support.,x
"She's been a great support from a lot of people who appreciate all that she has done over the years and for sharing her stories and making it something that benefits others, taking her pain and making it a gain for somebody else.",x
"Whereas the National Crime Center's Rights Week, NCVRW, is observed annually in the month of April and is dedicated to honoring crime victims and survivors while raising awareness about their rights and services, The NCVRW will be observed in 2025 the week of April 6th through the 12th.",x
"And whereas this year's theme is kinship, because this week is also about recognizing the efforts of those who support the victims and survivors of crime, And whereas crime affects individuals, families and communities in profound and varied ways, often leaving lasting physical, emotional and social challenges.",x
"And whereas the concept of kinship is a concept that is not just a concept of kinship, but is a concept of a collective connection.",x
"And whereas the concept of kinship highlights the bonds that create pathways to support resources and collective strength among survivors, advocates and communities.",x
"And whereas kinship lies at the heart of the victim advocacy, guiding, trauma-informed support that honors each survivor's unique journey.",x
"Through the strength of connection, we create peer networks and community partnerships that empower survivors, foster resilience and empower them to continue to make a difference- Thank you- And open doors to healing.",x
And whereas kinship reminds us of the importance of listening to every voice and the power that we have to create lasting change when we work together.,x
"And now, therefore, be it resolved that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh does hereby reaffirm its commitment to supporting crime victims in standing in kinship with survivors, And be it further resolved that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh does hereby declare the week of April 6th through the 12th 2025 as a day to recognize the survivors, And be it further resolved that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh does hereby declare the week of April 6th through the 12th 2025 as a day to recognize the survivors.",x
Thank you 25.,x
"as national crime victims rights week in the city of Pittsburgh, we have a motion to approve.",x
"second, all those in favor say aye, aye, any opposed.",x
congratulations again.,x
my name is Colleen Bowers.,x
"I'm very active in the Irish community and the reason why you see these two gentlemen dressed alike is the Pennsylvania State ancient order of hibernians president, Denny Maher, and also the Allegheny County president of the ancient order of hibernians, Bob Kelly.",x
"they joke that they're my eye candy, but these two gentlemen and the organizations for the ancient order of hibernians- it's not just in Pennsylvania, but nationally- and the ladies ancient order of hibernians have always been a supportive factor since my daughter died, and my mission in my statement is to promote domestic violence awareness, and to the point that we did get a PA house resolution 3, 3, 2 adopted through Dan DC, my state rep.",x
"so these are the things I've been doing, on top of all kind of other things.",x
everybody knows me.,x
"I'm not afraid to speak and not afraid to say hello, I need money, I need money, whatever the the case may be.",x
"With all that said, though, it boils down to, I approached Theresa to remind that this was Crime Victims Week.",x
"It's not just domestic violence, it's all victims of violence, And I applaud Theresa for taking that gauntlet and running with this And I hope from the future that the council will always remember this week- It's always in April, sometimes the dates change that.",x
"you always remember them and do some kind of a proclamation, so it's out there in the public forum.",x
"Other than that, Stephanie Fox was going to be here from the Center for Victims- and I cannot say enough about the Center for Victims with their resources for all victims of violence, between housing and so on- But she broke her leg So she had a little bit of difficulty today, So that's why she is not here to be here, you know, present, Thank you, But other than that.",x
"I thank Theresa, I thank the council, I thank my brother Hibernians for always being there and supporting Fact Point, And that's it, Thank you.",x
And I can tell you Councilman Calkin already promised me he'd take it up next year.,x
"Thank you so much, Mr Chairman.",x
"Thank you, Mr Chairman.",x
"Thank you, Mr Chairman.",x
"I translated about yesterday and continue to do it, and I'm going to tell you.",x
"You know it was easy, right, Right.",x
I remember you hearing about FEMA and you said: I'm still having this I'magadvularum as I speak.,x
"Oh, hey, I'm so glad, Debra, I bits.",x
I met those two years ago.,x
"It's great, Thank you.",x
"And with that we have one will of counsel, Councilman Sharland.",x
do you wish for it to be read in its entirety or the now?,x
"therefore, be it In its entirety, please.",x
"Thank you, Councilperson Sharland presents.",x
"Whereas Pittsburgh's Home Rule Charter states that a responsible city is one which expects aggressive action from its official towards the achievement of excellent health, safety and conditions conducive to human growth, And whereas the Pennsylvania Constitution outlines the right to the preservation of the national, scenic, historic and aesthetic values of the environment, And whereas this spring, melting snow has once again revealed filthy hillsides, And whereas the state of Pennsylvania has imposed a law that requires that all of its roads, trails, alleys, rights of way, catch basins and vacant land to be covered in trash, on the magnitude warranting a state of emergency and action by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.",x
"And whereas an accumulated refuse is described as slow violence and damages community health and perceptions, contributes to disorder and curbs in economic development, leading to disinvestment, especially in low-income communities.",x
And whereas previous monitoring and monitoring of the state of Pennsylvania has been a measure of the state's ability to protect its community from the effects of the pandemic.,x
And whereas the city has desserts and other fight for the nation's national health-based initiatives.,x
"And whereas the state's monitoring and litter assessment efforts by the city have highlighted concentrations of litter in our most impoverished neighborhoods, often home to minority and immigrant neighbors.",x
"And whereas more than 1,110 illegal dump sites have been identified in Pittsburgh since 2005, with more than 850 sites cleaned up.",x
"And whereas not all dump sites have been recorded, much less cleaned and recurring dumping at these known locations.",x
"And whereas not all dump sites have been recorded, much less cleaned and recurring dumping at these known locations suggest the true scale of the problem is much larger than reported.",x
"and whereas, while the work of nonprofit and community organizations, volunteers and the city's Department of Public Works to clean our neighbor, our neighborhoods, deserves acknowledgment.",x
these efforts are clearly not sustainable and fulfilling our responsibility to residents to maintain acceptable levels of cleanliness.,x
"and whereas, in recognition of the city's limitations, we asked the governor and the Commonwealth to lend all available equipment, contracts and funding and move the urgency to clean up and resolve these conditions harming public health and ruining the aesthetics of the environment.",x
"and now, therefore, be it resolved that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh calls on the governor to enact article 4, section 20, declaring the state of litter and trash on the ground in Pittsburgh of such magnitude to constitute an emergency and render essential the Commonwealth's supplementation of municipal resources to remove trash debris from publicly and privately owned land and to restore public health in our most livable city.",x
we have a motion to move to approve.,x
"is there a second, second discussion?",x
the first sponsor?,x
I just want to thank members for supporting this today.,x
you're gonna hear me beat this drum continually about the state of our city.,x
it is.,x
I had the opportunity over the weekend I was in Columbus for a day.,x
"being as filthy as we are is a choice, and we just stopped making that choice.",x
"so I am going to continue to work to make sure that our neighborhoods, all of our neighborhoods, are cleaned up, especially with the idea that the draft is coming here.",x
"we need to make sure that downtown is not the only neighborhood that we're proud of, that we can be proud of all 90 of our neighborhoods, and by removing the, the trash and dump sites around there.",x
"so I'm I'm hell-bent on this issue and, you know, I hope that other members will join me in that.",x
"thank you, thank you very much.",x
"so I have councilman Warwick, followed by councilman Smith, followed by councilman Gross, followed by councilman Cargill.",x
"councilman Warwick: yes, hi, can everyone hear me okay?",x
"yes, yeah, apologies, I have a sick kid at home.",x
"so, yeah, this came in yesterday, so I didn't really have the chance to review it or discuss it with the councilman, but I I would actually like my name to be removed, not because I don't care about the issue of litter- I'm going to leave it at that for now.",x
"i something i care deeply about, but i just i feel that you know we're somewhat abusing the ask of our governor to declare a state of emergency, you know, which has been reserved for incidents like snowmageddon in 2010 and the collapse of the fern hollow bridge in 2022.",x
"also, you know, re.",x
"you know, with regard to bernadette's comments earlier, i think that we really should be asking our governor and our state delegation at this moment in time to stay laser focused on the transit funding crisis that we are facing.",x
that could result in really the complete dissemination of our public transit systems.,x
"i'd also just, you know, would like to to remind members and and councilman charlotte, that this body recently voted on allocating 456 000 to the community neighborhood stewardship program through our public safety department.",x
"that was awarded to the center for employment opportunities, or ceo works, you know, which does workforce development for folks coming out of the carceral system.",x
and so they are they.,x
"you know they are now working to clean up garbage and litter in our most underserved communities and they are starting a multi-week cleanup in homewood, actually this week.",x
"so i'm sure you know that if, if the councilman reaches out to the public safety team, they'll be happy to to consider knoxville and other or or other communities in his districts.",x
"next, i also think that it is worth noting that, you know, while it certainly isn't enough, our dpw teams have nearly tripled the number of clean and liens that they're completing, you know, on private property since the pandemic and, if done, I believe it's 270 clean lanes in 2024.",x
Here in Pittsburgh We have nagging property owners who leave vacant properties covered in garbage.,x
We have too many residents who think it's okay to dump illegally and throw garbage out their car windows.,x
"We absolutely need to implement DPW's gold plan, which would create a dedicated litter-picking crew for the city, And we need to mobilize our Clean Pittsburgh Commission to expand education and outreach around the litter and illegal dumping across our communities.",x
I totally agree with the Councilman that it is not enough to count on our volunteers.,x
We need to get the money to our residents and our nonprofits.,x
"Shout out to Paul Lurie at Northside, Chris Armstrong at Squall Hill, Allegheny Cleanways, Friends of the Riverfront and so so many others.",x
"But I do feel that this is a solvable problem and one that we are really very close to tackling, And I look forward to continue working on it together with my fellow Councilmembers and our local partners and DPW and our public health, And I will continue to work with the public safety teams.",x
"So that's it for me, Thank you.",x
"Thank you, Councilman Smith.",x
Thank you.,x
"I actually want to go back a little bit and just give a little bit of history, My time here, Councilman Charlene.",x
"I actually started the anti-litter campaign, the grass-cutting campaign, the Clean and Lean Program, the e-recycling program and various other programs to worry about litter and all the blight across the city of Pittsburgh.",x
"So, although I appreciate that we're now saying that the state is doing a great job, I think we're doing a great job.",x
"Yeah, I think the state needs to pitch in.",x
Part of my problem in my district is state roads.,x
We have West Carson Street which is filled with litter and graffiti.,x
We have the West End Bridge which is filled the whole walkway.,x
You can't even walk on it.,x
It's filled with litter.,x
"Bicyclists, you know, call all the time.",x
They can't ride the bike going across it.,x
So there's all sorts of issues And all I would really like for them to do is take care of their part in the city of Pittsburgh.,x
"And then if we could focus on our part in the city of Pittsburgh, it would be amazing.",x
But I don't think that everything is in the state.,x
"I think that the state needs to pitch in, And also the national patients, COVID-19, coverage from our communities in our community.",x
But I think it's important to have that role.,x
That's what we really need to do.,x
"We're talking about most of our health institutions, but also across the nation.",x
"On top of that, there are to certainly not packed schools and salaries.",x
So we have several districts that are what we know would be as lack of services We have- I mean abroad in particular- But we need to encourage them.,x
"I think here is what we really really beyond this, would consider is an area that's not really accessible to the public until it's made up of a lot of ici Is about why it was made up of these towns that had all of this up there.",x
"I mean, we were making challenges and bringing them and ong with golf clubs and breaking down the physically deceiving property from Sheridan and boarded up a gazillion homes, took a walkthrough with BBI.",x
They made sure that they walked through with people.,x
They had the community walking through with them so they could give resources to people.,x
It was a combination and it was a collaborative effort.,x
It's not going to take one thing or one group or one effort.,x
This has been going on for a long time.,x
"But we need- and we haven't had in all those years- is the enforcement of the laws and the educational component, because a lot of the people littering and doing some of the things that we're complaining about are, I think are between the ages of 14 and 25.",x
So education piece is important and making sure people understand.,x
This past weekend we had a tremendous amount of young people- and I'm going to acknowledge them- Hope for Tomorrow Kids and the kids from the West End Boxing Academy at Langley where they did the garbage derby in Sheridan- the Sheridan Garbage Derby- And I think that's a great example of what we're doing.,x
And I think that's a great example of what we're doing.,x
"And there were- it was the biggest crowd they ever had and they had a ton of kids from Hope for Tomorrow and the boxing program that were eager to clean up, eager to participate in the community and wanting to see there could be a wanting the community to be clean that way all the time and wanting to be a part of the solution in the community.",x
So I do think an education component is what is needed more than anything.,x
But I do think we have to have enforcement.,x
There are cameras that we had.,x
We should be enforcing the illegal dumping that's occurring in the city.,x
We should be enforcing the illegal dumping that's occurring in the city of Pittsburgh.,x
"And Missy Rosenthal, I do want to say she ran the anti-litter campaign.",x
She lives in Councilman Cog Hill's district.,x
"She's also out with breast cancer, So she's having a rough time.",x
"My thoughts and prayers are definitely with Missy, But I want to make sure that we acknowledge her work and what she's done to start that program, because when she was there she was out there picking up the litter, She was out there with cameras, She was out there catching people and she was also out there trying to educate people in the schools.",x
"She worked with kids in the school, She worked with kids in different schools across the city And she got them involved in the cleanup part.",x
"So while I support Councilman Charland in this today, I just really have deep concerns about the way we're doing this And I'd like to know what the status is of the graffiti busters, because I haven't seen this much graffiti in the city in a very, very long time And I think that there was a lot going on around that I'm not sure I heard.",x
"You know, I've heard different things.",x
We have a lot of abandoned vehicles and a lot of those vehicles need – we pulled our complaints of all our unresponded issues over the past few years.,x
"There are 25 pages of abandoned vehicles, Twenty-five pages of vehicles that still need towed.",x
So they are definitely part of the problem.,x
"So I wish that we would look at a bigger picture, a more comprehensive picture, And instead of putting all these efforts, you know, separately, we would combine them and really work together with the state, because it's not just the state's responsibility, It's not just the city's responsibility, And we have a lot of county roads, So it's also not just the county roads, So it's not just the city's responsibility, It's not just the county roads, It's not just the county roads, It's not just the county roads, It's not just the county roads.",x
So it would be nice if we worked collectively and with various departments to come up with a better plan in general.,x
"Thank you, Thank you, Councilwoman Gross.",x
Thank you.,x
I appreciate my council members' knowledge and attention to this matter.,x
"I think there's a lot of really good things that have been said, also by Councilwoman Warwick and Councilwoman Smith, But I would also like my name removed from the will of council.",x
"Thank you, That's all, Mr Taylor.",x
"Thank you, Thank you.",x
"Thank you, Mr President.",x
"Thank you, Councilman Corkill.",x
"Thank you, Mr Chairman.",x
"First I want to start out with saying you know I applaud you, Councilman Sharland, I really do.",x
"You know, this is nothing new for him.",x
"Most of us, I think, were here when he got sworn in.",x
He stood up there on his swearing-in stage and said: the city is filthy and I want to clean it up.,x
I haven't forgotten that And I really appreciate your efforts and passion that you're putting toward this.,x
"As you know, I started my my own cleanup crew in my own district only because I just couldn't stand the sight of it anymore.",x
I really couldn't.,x
"We clean up, We focused on more so properties that our public works employees are not to go on.",x
We go on private property.,x
"We go on PennDOT property And I agree with you, Councilwoman Kale-Smith: Yeah, it's the county and the state that are the biggest abusers, And if they could clean up their roads as well as they plow them, I would be happy.",x
We want to be clear.,x
They're not the biggest abusers.,x
They're not the biggest abusers.,x
"They're not the biggest abusers, But they just have their own responsibilities too.",x
"Yes, they do, And they don't take care of them.",x
So we'll pitch in.,x
"We clean up garbage wherever it is And I try to do areas that, again, that our public works crews are kind of forbidden to do.",x
"That being said, our public works crews and I want to thank, you know, Director Hornstein, I want to thank Jeff Cook And I want to thank John McClory.",x
They have been fantastic.,x
I found partners in them.,x
"So we bag it, We put it on the side of the road, They come pick it up Or they'll come and They'll finish an area.",x
So we've created a good partnership with them And I'm thankful to them for that.,x
"If the council, If this bill helps us be able to more legally go on private properties, go in and just clean it up, Because it truly is a health hazard.",x
"We were on a private property yesterday And you know, it's just, It's really a health hazard issue.",x
"People have to live next to it And they don't want it And they don't care who cleans it up, They just want it cleaned up.",x
So I've been cleaning it up And I'm not worried about lawsuits or anything like that.,x
They can sue me.,x
"In fact, I'm looking for them.",x
So you know we're wanting to know where they are.,x
We want them to clean it up.,x
"So, again, I will wholeheartedly support this.",x
I thank you for your efforts And I hope this can remove some red tape in us cleaning up the entire city.,x
"So thanks again, Thank you.",x
"Any further discussion, Councilman Mosley?",x
"Yeah, I just want to say I truly appreciate Councilman Sharman's concerns On this issue and your steadfast commitment to this issue.",x
That's one of the reasons why I enthusiastically supported the quality of life legislation we passed recently.,x
"But I would like you know my name to be removed as a sponsor, Not because I disagree.",x
"I wholeheartedly agree and look forward to continuing working with Councilman Sharman, you know, on these issues.",x
"But I am, you know, concerned about the state of our public transit And I do feel as if we make an ask of this magnitude to the governor, I would prioritize public transportation.",x
"I don't know how many opportunities we're going to have to go back to the well, But, Councilman Sharman, I look forward to continue working with you.",x
"you know on these issues And you know- it's not that I'm against it or I even disagree, you know, with you rising to this level, But I do think that you know to declare a state of emergency.",x
"I do think we need to prioritize public transit, you know, in this current moment.",x
"But you know I applaud Councilman Sharman's steadfast dedication, you know, to this issue And I look forward to continue working with him, Thank you.",x
Thank you.,x
Any other comments.,x
"First round, I got you.",x
second round.,x
"If not, I'll quickly chime in and maybe offer what I would consider to be a potential compromise, Councilman Sharman.",x
One just to Councilman Caldwell's point.,x
"this won't allow the city- and feel free to correct me if I'm wrong- this will not allow, this will not empower the city to go into private property to do more cleaning.",x
"Rather, it's a request to the state to come in And assist and bring resources where the city and supplement the resources that the city may have.",x
"So sorry, were you pausing?",x
"Go ahead, Okay, No, it is.",x
I'm not specific in cutting through.,x
you know how we want to cut through red tape.,x
I'm asking for logistical support.,x
"Something like that might be what we consider logistical support, But I don't know what all the states.",x
I don't know what the state can offer us.,x
"My hope here is that, by making this declaration, that we can ask for the assistance of the state, which there is precedent for elsewhere.",x
"Thank you, If I'm not aware of the precedent, I would love to learn about it.",x
That's my own ignorance.,x
"With that being said, one let me just: You have been beating this drum since you first took office, So I believe you'll be consistent in that And I believe, in many respects, you're making your predecessor very proud.",x
"This time of year, almost every year, Councilman Krause would talk about once the snow leaves, once you can see through the trees how off our hillsides look right, And this was something he often and frequently talked about, And you're continuing that work, So I congratulate you for that.",x
"With that being said, specific to the will of Council, I actually agree with your sentiment And I agree with your ask And I agree with 95% of what is written here, Based on what I've heard from members, based on my own concern about declaring a state of emergency for litter.",x
"prior to this, the first Well, since 2010, we had Snowmageddon, which was declared a state of emergency.",x
"We had COVID, which was our next state of emergency, Then the Fern Hollow Bridge and then the Second Avenue Shelter.",x
"I believe those are the four that we've had, And I agree with Councilman Mosley and others that if we're going to ask for a state of emergency, if we were asking one for our hillsides that are falling down, that would be understandable, because it's literally a serious.",x
"We're talking about saving lives at that point, Even if we're talking about transportation.",x
"in many respects, if we followed it all the way out.",x
"we are talking about saving lives, So I do have a concern about asking for a state of emergency for litter.",x
"If my friendly recommendation would be to slightly reword it so that your last paragraph read: Now: therefore, be it resolved that the Council of the City of Pittsburgh calls on the Governor to- And I would remove the state of emergency portion and go to where you finish it off and go- Render essential Commonwealth supplementation of municipal resources to remove trash to be from publicly privately owned land and to restore public health in our most livable city.",x
I think that is completely reasonable And I think that's a fair ask.,x
I don't think we should be declaring a state of emergency at this point.,x
That's my only.,x
"My goal is to try to thread the needle to get a body to fully support your will of council, which I think, by and large, we all agree with the sentiment of it.",x
I think some of us just have a concern about the state of emergency portion.,x
Second round.,x
"Councilwoman Smith, Thank you.",x
I just want to clarify a few things.,x
The state: We work really well with the state in our side of town.,x
"We do work really well with Dan Deasy, Senator Fontana and Georgia.",x
John McClory does an amazing job on our side.,x
"As a matter of fact, he's cleaning up two dump sites today in Sheridan.",x
So I do want to say that.,x
But we have the right to go on private property if it's a public safety concern.,x
You have that right.,x
We do it now.,x
We used to have help from the county in terms of hoarding and those types of properties.,x
"They stopped that, So they have left the city of Pittsburgh with absolutely no resources to handle mental health calls or mental health issues in terms of hoarding And you can see go on Stratmore Street in Crafton Heights, two homes side by side and what people are living next to, And I have sent that over to the Public Safety Department And the chief of the Fire Bureau has the authority to go in and make sure that that property is either cleaned up or demoed, because it becomes now a safety concern for our firefighters and for the residents living nearby.",x
"So when there's a public health concern, they do have a right to go on private property.",x
They do have some rights to do some things.,x
"I think we use all these different things as excuses not to do some stuff, But the fact of the matter is this has been an issue since I've been here 16 years And we still have not managed to make it such a priority that we're going on to the private properties and the blighted properties to clean them up and to make the area safe.",x
So I'm going to support Councilman Charland because I know that his heart's really in this and he wants to do.,x
I know his intentions are good in wanting to see something done here.,x
I wanted to make sure that And I also thought out that we have some responsibilities.,x
"I think what we need to do truthfully is to sit down all together and we do with our briefings and come up with better plans for handling blight, including vacant properties, the debris on the side of the road, graffiti.",x
All those things are together.,x
"They're not individual, They're not isolated.",x
"They're things that work together against the community, And so I think if we would come up with something better together, I think that would be our part.",x
I'm also.,x
I know if we're helping to clean up.,x
"I've been doing it for years, but it's really getting.",x
"It's just disgusting because it's not isolated, It's all over the place.",x
"You can see it and you can see the blight And residents are complaining about it, Kids are complaining about it And Councilman Caldwell's actually cleaning up sites himself and I'm getting all kinds of accolades for him for everything he's been doing.",x
He's out there actually doing it and cleaning it up.,x
So And I know we all participate in cleanups.,x
"So I just think that we I'd rather not do such aconditions at Councilman Caldwell when you're doing a cleanup and saying you've got this, I'm glad he did what he did.",x
I love what he's doing.,x
It makes better things And we don't see any boards stepping in here in order to protect the community.,x
"When we got the called to the City Council, we did it in order to protect this city and their community, the community, community And the of the best things that a city can do.",x
We all are vuel strangers.,x
We're in a mess.,x
"first want to say: you know, when I agreed to sign on to councilman Charlene's bill, not only am I enthusiastic about the same and have the same interests of cleaning the city of Pittsburgh up, you know, I also felt that in no way did I feel that this would be sidetracking the governor from supporting financially our transit system just because the state of the emergency tag is on it.",x
"state of emergency doesn't necessarily mean financial means of great abundance and I don't think you specified that in any which way in the bill, at least not that I caught so and I would have a hard time supporting it myself honestly.",x
"but you know I always say it's cost nothing to pick trash up, it's really cheap and state of emergency means for me that's cut-throat.",x
"you know I always say it's cost nothing to pick trash up, it's really cheap and state of emergency means for me that's cut-throat red tape.",x
"let's make sure the county and state cleans their roads up, and I'll leave it up to councilman Charlene whether he wants to keep that tag on there or not.",x
"but in no way do I feel, or I felt, that this would be interfering with funding that would go through transit or landslides or anything of that nature.",x
"so and I want to say one other thing: you know we clean up sides of roads, we clean up private, probably clean up everywhere.",x
"but I will tell you I'm getting a small, very tiny percentage of what's really there.",x
"most of these roads, you know it's- I get alongside the road and about four or five feet in I get what you could see.",x
"what I get is probably about 20% of what is actually out there, I will tell you.",x
"and all these roads that are the main problem areas, usually roads coming in and out of our neighborhoods and and all of these roads you know, beyond, what you can see is again, seventy percent of where the real trash is.",x
"so, as of the you know, if you have a WCCO steakhouse that checked out, you know supposed to take a break and just small block away does that allow for anybody to walk there?",x
we were looking storming off.,x
we had to clear storming off of it.,x
"so I'm wondering where you'd be finding that road- and always, Matt, WCCO, least alongside the roads, because i know, you know, another three, four weeks, once that vegetation starts, we don't see it.",x
"i know it's there and that still bothers me, but you know, typically you don't see it as much because of the vegetation.",x
"so i look forward to making the city clean, i look forward to supporting councilman charlton's efforts in doing so, at least in, you know, his district.",x
"and yeah, and again, i'd like to talk further about a deeper clean, where 70 percent of what we are picking up is not being picked up and that's where it's a public health safety issue, i believe.",x
"so okay, that's it, thank you, mr president, thank you, councilman gross.",x
again i want to say that i think this is a really good conversation and just council members kind of sharing the problems that they are seeing and also other programs that are really important to the city of california and the city of california and the city of california are working.,x
including city departments in their district.,x
is is really helpful and i've taken a lot of notes.,x
i'll just throw in one example that i wasn't going to mention.,x
"but on illegal dumping, i have a request in because i just got a report from neighbors this weekend that they've seen landscaping companies dumping their waste into catch basins, into the storm drains of our sewer system.",x
"that we spend money cleaning out- right, that money comes from us, right from your, from your pwsa bills.",x
right to that we have to replace those storm drains.,x
that we buy large vacuum trucks at pwsa to vacuum out clogged sewers.,x
"that when both either the drain or the entire sewer line- main sewer line- is clogged, we have to replace those sewer lines and that rainwater that comes up from the sewer line without any water it's not a major problem.",x
all that water comes up.,x
we've got flooding on your roads.,x
"when that happens all winter long, it busts up freezing thought, busts up your streets.",x
that's costing us money too.,x
so i just- that was a new one to me- that we actually have people- i've had reports of vendors from food trucks dumping all of their cooking oil into catch basins.,x
"right, we've certainly had reports of broken catch basins because of large vehicles driving over those kinds of things.",x
"we spend millions of dollars replacing the actual infrastructure alone of just to have like the stronger, newer.",x
"you'll see them someplace with the big metal grates, and so it's just.",x
"it just kind of boggles the mind the number of things that we have to be vigilant about, and so i just thought i'd throw that one in there for the discussion.",x
"thank you, thank you.",x
"any further discussion, councilman charlotte?",x
"thank you, thank you, thank you.",x
"so you know i appreciate comments from members here and you know i i do firmly believe that, especially when we consider all the detrimental impacts to trash, between the health impacts from, you know, plastic leaching into our waters, the, the economic impacts, the public safety impacts, of the strong correlation between trash and violence, i do believe that this is a state of emergency.",x
"however, i will take the council president's advice and if we want to strike the state of emergency off of this, you know my, my intent.",x
my heart still believes that this is a state of emergency.,x
this is a five alarm fire.,x
this is something that we need more help than we are able to to get through.,x
"things that we can do on the margins, you know, i like hiring ceo works and and bringing in some- some great folks, but some non-union folks- to help out in our cities.",x
"that's great, but that's not enough.",x
"what we're doing right now is not nearly enough, and the purpose of a system is what it does.",x
"our systems are created right now to allow our cities to be filthy, and i i understand by that, but i'm obviously very impassioned about this.",x
"if it would make the council president feel better, i'd be happy to remove the state of emergency from this.",x
"but you know, i want all members to know, and i want the governor to know, that i believe this is the state of emergency and i also believe that someone with the capacity of the of the governor has the ability to both walk and chew the gum at the same time.",x
i don't think that this would at all impede a public transit crisis.,x
i just don't believe that that's that's the case here.,x
but happy to make that concession.,x
"yeah, i, i don't.",x
i don't know how that works.,x
"actually, that was going to be my question for the clerk.",x
"if this were legislation, i would need to have a written amendment striking language for a council.",x
am i able to do that?,x
"okay, so the clerk informs me that because it's a will of council, we can't strike language.",x
"so with that, does that require a vote?",x
"madam clerk, i would think so.",x
does that require a vote to strike the language?,x
"okay, so if someone- i can't do it- if someone would offer a motion to strike the language, simply declaring the state of emergency, keeping everything else intact, all right.",x
"i'd like to make a motion to strike the part of the sentence in the now they're appropriate resolved that begins after calls on the governor 2, and then the strikeout begins with the word and act second, and then, well, i have to say, when it ends.",x
so i was just giving clerk time to catch up.,x
"i was like watching her, right.",x
i asked him.,x
"but i asked him, councilwoman, he didn't want to.",x
so the strike up begins with the word and act.,x
"so the motion is to strike, beginning with the word and act and continuing through magnitude to constitute- constitute an emergency- and and then ends correct, you would keep render and then they will keep render essential the commonwealth supplementation of municipal resources.",x
"thank you, is there a second second?",x
"all those in favor say aye, aye, aye.",x
any opposed any further discussion on the will of council as now amended?,x
"madam, i just i'm sorry.",x
i just want to thank councilman charlotte because he's he's definitely come through and has made this a real priority for him and i and i.,x
"you know, i hate to say it, but it's election season, so we're going to see all kinds of things now and i just want to make sure that we're not governing according to what's you know next happening in in a year and a half, and then we're going to see a lot of things happening and i just want to make sure that we're not going to see a lot of things happening in the elections.",x
"i want to make sure what we're doing is, you know, effective and the best you know course of action for the city of pittsburgh and our residents on all sides, because i see it happening on all sides and i just want to remind people that you know, this is something that does affect our people and it's been going on for a while.",x
so it would have been nice to see some response before this.,x
"it'd be nice to see some response after this, but i want to thank councilman charlotte because i know, no matter what happens at the end of may, he's going to continue this battle.",x
"thank you, any further discussion, councilman kaku?",x
"yeah, just quickly.",x
i just want to make clear.,x
councilman mchale smith just reminded me election season.,x
"most of my district has has been saying, oh, he's cleaning up it's selection time.",x
i just want to remind them i'm unopposed in the may primary.,x
so it's not.,x
that's not the case.,x
i have jackets and signs and everything.,x
i've had them made up for at least two or three years now and- and that's why i brought up councilman charlotte- i remember him being sworn in and i remember it being the most like refreshing thing that i knew him very well before he got sworn in.,x
"but for him to address that on that podium when he was sworn in, i wanted to remind the city and his district that you know he's been on this for a long time.",x
this is nothing new and it's not political.,x
"i wouldn't think: thanks, thank you.",x
"i'll simply add one: thank you for your willingness to compromise, councilman.",x
i do appreciate that.,x
"two: there have been a number of us over a period of time now who have talked about the fact that we as a body at some point probably need to collectively address the issues of trash, and we have a list of issues that we need to address- whether it's regarding transit, whether it's regarding the environment, whether it's regarding trash- where we sort of collectively put together a list and spend time there walking those halls so that we can indeed get the resources necessary, and i'd be more than willing to become one better educated on the topic so that, when we're there, we could add this to a list of necessary subjects to then have a conversation with the governor about what resources can he actually bring to assist us and supplement what we currently have.",x
"first, i'm er had lots of papers over here.",x
"councilman cocky of sure, public safety and wellness.",x
"thank you, mr president.",x

"aye, nine, ayes, zero, noes.",x
the bill have received a legal number of votes is passed.,x
"finally, that takes us to motions and resolutions.",x
is there anything from members?,x
"councilman Smith, I actually have quite a bit sorry.",x
"you might as well sit down, I know how this feels.",x
"I just want to talk a little bit about some of the things that have been happening and I've been seeing since this election, and a lot of it is.",x
I know that it's related to the to everybody you know running and all the tension and council divided amongst who was supporting or whether they're supporting or whatever they're doing.,x
"but I'm gonna tell you I better not hear another word about council chasing the chief of police out of the city of Pittsburgh during it there, during any kind of comments.",x
"because I have right here the text messages between me and the chief- and the last time I, he and I, spoke was before before.",x
"this last email text message was Thursday February 2nd 2023, and that was when he was my commander.",x
"then we didn't speak again until Wednesday, December 11th, and he says: thank you for the chat.",x
today I feel better and appreciate you taking the time.,x
does that sound like a man who was threatened?,x
does that sound like a man that wants to leave the city of Pittsburgh?,x
and then I- and then I said it was a good meeting with you.,x
I'll have my staff preparing the amendment regarding the chief's salary.,x
I talked to him about the chief's salary.,x
I thought it was unfair that we lowered his salary without even talking to him.,x
"nobody told him that he was gonna lose about eighteen thousand dollars a year, but yet we paid Larry's grotto that much more and he let, came here, left here and then came back.",x
so I felt like chief Raglan at the time deserved- at least because he stayed- that increased salary and he said: I appreciate that as well.,x
sorry here about the passing of your mother.,x
my prayers and condolences.,x
thank you so much.,x
that was our only communication together in a text.,x
so when people talk they better know what they're saying.,x
"because that's not what happened, at least not with he and I.",x
"and during a meeting with six witnesses he said: I said during the meeting, if you're talking about commander ripple and what he wants, he doesn't want to be an assistant chief under you and he doesn't want to be a chief under a mayor's race with a mayor's race pending.",x
"he, he only wants to be treated with respect.",x
could you meet with him and talk with him the way you have with others?,x
and he agreed.,x
so I'm gonna just say you know I don't mind if I say something.,x
I'm gonna tell you I say something.,x
"I don't care, if you like, if I advocate for chief of police, just like other members called people and said: why don't you become the chief?",x
"so if I want to say that, I'll say that, but I didn't.",x
so I'm not gonna take blame for something I didn't say.,x
"then we had the interviews for the housing authority and you know, after those interviews- I think I explained at the time and then maybe I didn't explain well enough, so I'm gonna explain right now- I sent a text message, not about the people that were there that the next day, but about the people that were there the first day, and I said I was mostly concerned about wasi Muhammad because I really liked wasi and I didn't want to vote against him.",x
"so I said to my, to Dan frees and who now works in my office: is there any conflict of interest I need to be aware of?",x
because because they are funded by the federal government and I just wanted to make sure because he works for the federal government.,x
"and he said: responded: you know, yes, and if anybody receives grant money, does it.",x
so I didn't realize that.,x
"he said: well, make sure you get the opinion from the ethics department or ethics Commission, which I failed to do.",x
"and when they vote came up, I didn't want to vote against anybody.",x
"I don't want to wait and say: hold for an ethics Commission opinion, legal opinion, because I don't want to delay anybody else.",x
and then I said I'll abstain from TME's because the other three said they never received city dollars.,x
she said she had to vote against the city dollars and I said I don't want to wait.,x
and I said I can't wait.,x
I need to tell you why I that was stupid.,x
she said that's because she didn'toll brought.,x
she said he has that government fais with.,x
there's not integritya non shifts.,x
"whatever you're doing, good, Everybody's on the payroll right now.",x
as a you did.,x
yes is the purpose.,x
"I'd say I shiftingAT Olga Hill, I literally turned my、 out Inspire R Kn tenho included in everything that we get, any packages that we get.",x
"But part of what I am most concerned about is I have never seen council members, never seen council members get dragged into a race with the mayor's office where we disrespected one another, where we jumped on social media like two-year-olds and tried to, you know, jump in the conversations.",x
I've never seen us do that kind of stuff.,x
I've always seen us treat each other with respect And what I've noticed over this past time- the sense of decorum in this council and with members.,x
"some of them are newer, some of them have been here for a long time.",x
What I've noticed is how brutal it is.,x
And I'm going to say this: I have never trashed Ed Gainey.,x
I would never trash people.,x
"I don't do that, I may get upset.",x
I may say we don't get along.,x
"There's tension between us, That's not trashing somebody.",x
"And so what I will say is: I think that these jobs are just not for the good of the people, And I think that's what I'm going to say.",x
I think that these jobs are just not for the good of the people.,x
And so what I will say is: I think that these jobs are just not for the good of the people.,x
And so what I will say is: I think that these jobs are just not for the good of the people.,x
And so what I will say is: I think that these jobs are just not for the good of the people.,x
And so what I will say is: I think that these jobs are just not for the good of the people.,x
And so what I will say is: I think that these jobs are just not for the good of the people.,x
And so what I will say is: I think that these jobs are just not for the good of the people.,x
And so the Thanks.,x
"Mr president, that position in that public safety is.",x
"it is a really challenging situation and I don't blame anybody for the the state of the police to Bureau in terms of the the chief or not having a chief, or what, how many chiefs we have.",x
"what I do blame us for is the way that we treat people, and- and that was one of my biggest concerns previously- is that what we heard- so many complaints from people in the way they were treated, and so I just I don't want to keep bringing this back up and rehashing, but I'm just not going to be used for your political- you know- commentaries and your political stuff and saying things because you have an agenda.",x
"I mean, the reason why there is such tension, the reason why people like Donald Trump get elected, is because of all these kinds of comments, all these kinds of tensions, these because, like, you're not supposed to say a word or do anything.",x
I mean it's just getting to the point where people are so frustrated with us that they're looking for anything that's different and crazy.,x
"to be honest with you, they just have had it with us and I think, seeing it, what's happening here locally, I've had it with us and I'm gonna start saying a lot more, a lot more publicly, if we're going to continue this road and, believe me, I have a lot more, and so does councilman Coghill.",x
so I think that people should just respect the fact that we're trying to be respectful and going forward and working together.,x
"we're trying to keep what we can here is with some sense of decorum and realize we're working with our colleagues, not our enemies, and that you know we may be on different political agendas or different political pages sometimes, and that's the way that we're working and that's okay.",x
"that's what makes the world different, that's what makes us, that's what makes us unique and and those things are okay.",x
"I could just say a lot more, but I'm gonna shut up right now, thank you.",x
thank you any other member?,x
if not.,x
we do have meeting announcements.,x
"this afternoon at one o'clock, council holding executive session on bills 1709 and 1710 as relates to ongoing litigation.",x
"also, this afternoon at 1: 30, council will hold a post agenda on division zero annual memo, which is shared by a councilwoman, Walden, and the council will hold a pre-agenda interview at 9: 30 am for the Clean Pittsburgh Commission and the Housing Authority.",x

"speaker registration will close at 9 am, Wednesday morning.",x
"to register to speak at this meeting, please, with a sign up form on the council meeting web page.",x
you may also call the clerk's office at 412 255 2138 in a motion to approve the minutes and adjourn the meeting.,x
"so move, all those in favor say: aye, adjourn you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you.",x
