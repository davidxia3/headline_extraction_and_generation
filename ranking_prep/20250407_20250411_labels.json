The group has several subcommittees focused on enforcement, budget, education, and crash response.\n\n- A new Fatal Crash Response Team visits the site of every deadly crash within two weeks to identify and make quick, low-cost safety improvements, such as adding signs or pavement markings to make roads clearer for drivers.\n\n- The city is in the process of selecting a vendor to launch an automated red-light camera enforcement program this year at several locations. Officials also plan to ask the state for permission to use automated speed enforcement cameras.\n\n- A \"Community Traffic Calming Toolkit\" is being developed to allow residents to make their own temporary safety improvements, like placing approved planters to improve visibility at corners. The city is waiting to hear back on a grant to help launch the program.\n\n- Officials noted that state-owned roads like Penn and Fifth avenues make up only 12% of roads in Pittsburgh but are the site of nearly half of all crashes.
