Headline 1: City Council discusses pause and funding challenges for Four Mile Run flood mitigation projects
Summary 1: - Pittsburgh Water has paused four major flood mitigation projects, including the Four Mile Run project, primarily due to funding challenges and increased construction costs.
- The Four Mile Run project is at 90% design but lost $10 million in funding after green infrastructure elements were removed, reducing its combined sewer overflow (CSO) reduction benefits below the funding threshold.
- Total project costs are estimated at $40 million, with about $8.7 million already spent on planning and design; construction alone is expected to cost around $30 million.
- Funding priorities have shifted toward mandated projects like the $470 million Water Reliability Plan, which addresses critical drinking water infrastructure and is court-ordered.
- Technical and permitting issues, including disagreements over stream lining and railroad right-of-way constraints, also complicated the Four Mile Run project.
- Pittsburgh Water continues to maintain existing infrastructure and respond to flooding complaints despite the project pause.
- The Army Corps of Engineers highlighted potential federal funding programs that could support future stormwater projects if Pittsburgh Water pursues partnerships.
- Councilmembers expressed concern over the impact on residents, especially in Four Mile Run, where flooding and sewage backups remain serious problems.
- Pittsburgh Water plans to complete design work and conduct hydraulic evaluations to assess recent improvements, such as the M-29 outfall reconstruction.
- Community engagement and transparent communication are planned before any future public meetings on the project’s status and next steps.

Headline 2: Council holds public hearing and advances bill to reduce minimum lot sizes in residential zoning districts
Summary 2: - The City Council held a public hearing on Bill 1579, which aims to reduce minimum lot size requirements across Pittsburgh’s residential zoning districts to encourage more housing development and affordability.  
- The bill lowers minimum lot sizes as follows:  
  - Very Low-Density: from 8,000 to 6,000 sq. ft.  
  - Low-Density: from 5,000 to 3,000 sq. ft.  
  - Moderate Density: from 3,200 to 2,400 sq. ft.  
  - High Density: from 1,800 to 1,200 sq. ft.  
  - Very High Density: removes minimum lot size entirely.  
- It also eliminates minimum lot size per unit requirements, which currently restrict multi-unit housing development, especially duplexes and triplexes.  
- The reform addresses a major barrier where many existing lots (up to over 50% in some districts) do not meet current minimum lot sizes, making many homes technically illegal and new development difficult without variances.  
- Supporters emphasized that the bill would legalize many existing homes, allow more modest and affordable housing types, increase housing supply, and promote walkability and transit use.  
- The bill is based on recommendations from the 2022 Housing Needs Assessment and has been vetted through extensive public engagement and planning commission approval without conditions.  
- Several speakers urged passing this bill quickly to address Pittsburgh’s housing crisis, while also calling for the full comprehensive zoning package—including inclusionary zoning and parking reforms—to be adopted together for maximum impact.  
- Some opponents expressed concerns about potential neighborhood crowding, gentrification, and the piecemeal approach of separating this bill from the full zoning reform package.  
- Councilmembers sponsoring the bill highlighted the need to move forward with this “clean fix” now to unlock vacant lots, reduce red tape, and align zoning with the city’s historic built environment.  
- The hearing concluded with broad council support to advance the bill while acknowledging ongoing debates about the broader housing reform package.

Headline 3: Council schedules special meeting to address EMS, fire, and police fleet issues
Summary 3: - Councilman Coghill called for a special post-agenda meeting focused on the condition of the EMS, fire, and police vehicle fleets due to recent ambulance breakdowns during emergency calls.  
- The last full fleet review was two years ago, and little progress has been made in funding or repairs since then.  
- Coghill emphasized the urgency of addressing life-saving equipment failures and plans to hear directly from department directors about the current state of their fleets.  
- Council President and other members supported scheduling the meeting as soon as possible, ideally next week, citing public safety risks and the need for transparent discussion.  
- The council agreed unanimously to hold this focused session to explore solutions and necessary investments to ensure reliable emergency response vehicles.
