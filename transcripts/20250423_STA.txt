My name is Yvonne F Brown. I live at 715 Mercer Street. That's the high rise at the top of Bedford. Now on April the 22nd, on KDKA, I heard Cory O'Connor having an interview. Now some of the things that he said and I took it from this. he said that he said that he was going to be a member of the KDKA. and he said that he was going to be a member of the KDKA. He tried to make an appointment with the mayor but the mayor has a nonprofit organization, family something and he could never get an appointment. Well, the same way with me. I live up in the KDKA and when the mayor came up to the building and brought a proclamation and a plaque for Salah Uddin's previous council meeting, the councilman's brother, who had just moved into the city, came from California. He had came in and he gave him a proclamation and a plaque for cleaning up in front of August Wilson's house, which is up on Bedford. When that happened I was really upset. I'm saying, how did he even know about August? how did he even know about Salah Uddin's brother? That's one of his cronies? So I went to the mayor and I said, Mayor, I don't want to foreshow or bring light on you without me explaining what it's about. I want to know how you knew about Salah Uddin's brother. He got very offensive. He said: well, you got a problem with it? And I said, yes, I do, Because August Wilson told me to keep coming down and telling my story, otherwise it's history, your history. Okay, This mayor, I don't appreciate him and I don't think that he is mere material. And I was saying something to the community. I'm saying: did you see how much did the mayor only got like 20,000 or 30,000 in his campaign. But Cory O'Connor got 300,000. And I'm saying, but he's Irish. And then I remember, oh, his mother was Jewish. So, citizen The Jewish, have that, The Jewish have that O'Connor. O'Connor probably will be the mayor. Now, one thing I do must say about O'Connor: you gotta give credit where credit's due. He had much respect for us citizens in this place. He would be there at 10 o'clock sitting and waiting. He would speak to me, even though his father didn't and my councilmen don't, And he would say: Ms Brown, how are you today? And I looked at him and I said: you know what, Cory, if your father knew that you were, if you treated me the way you are, I said he would turn over in his grave Because O'Connor did not like me and I did not care for him because he was not that good of a president. Thank you, and just have a nice day. Thank you, Ms Brown. Next speaker, please? Hi, my name is Herbert Flaherty Jr. I've been living in this. actually, I'm just a city resident. I'm homeless. right now I'm in and out of jail. a lot- institutions, programs- I notice a lot of things in this city, in the jail and in all the programs and things the city has to offer- which it ain't much, You know- I notice a lot like they'll push you to jail or to this program or to this program, to this program to keep putting a Band-Aid on a problem. I'm 36 years old. I was born in 89. I grew up in a city that was a little bit more of a place where you could go to church And the city always wasn't the greatest growing up. You know what I mean. It was a rough city. Most people didn't have an education And we grew up living the streets And as I got older and I started to go to church, I found God. I started going to jail And I started looking like there's no real reform, There's no real education And I started going to the renewal center or the ACJ or all these programs And they don't teach anybody anything. It would be cost efficient and cheaper to teach criminals or people that are uneducated, a trade just in anything. You know what I mean In chemical, engineering and carpentry and skills like that, A place where you could go. instead of being housed at 952nd Avenue or 339 Boulevard of the Allies, they could have a place like that. It was a place where you could go. They could have a place like that where they offer people an educational program the whole time they're there, Like a DOC program with college tutors and stuff there. You know what I mean: To teach people a proper education, because the city has an entire asset of a workforce. You know what I mean. There's got to be at least I know maybe a million people without a job that are able to work- You know what I mean- That are able to learn something and get an education And they're probably willing to be taught if they could be housed in a place like a Job Corps. You know, most people don't see the light until they're 25 And it's too late to go to Job Corps. It's too late to do this, It's too late to that And they get institutionalized and they just keep going back to jail, rehab, the streets, renewal center, wherever. And if the city, I want to draw up a proposal for a lot of things And if the city could give the youth, or even the youth, even people that are older, an education- you know what I mean- And house them properly and give them a chance to learn and succeed and thrive. Maybe a new building or a college campus to teach adults how to be productive members of society. You know what I mean. I think that would be more cost efficient than sending them to rehabs, jails or being homeless or all over the city time and time after time. Thank you, Thank you very much. Thank you, Thank you very much. Next speaker, please, Good morning. Special Agent Sunshine. Thank you, Lord, for bringing me here. I return to sender any voodoo, hexes, curses, anybody tries to send to me Death magic y'all been doing every day, daily. I return it to sender 100 million, billion, trillion, Googleplex And whoever's sending it. Lord, throw them into a lake of fire. In Jesus' name, I pray amen. Dear God, thank you for equipping me to represent you in this world. Please give me the strength and wisdom to reflect you well so that others are drawn to you. That's a lot he has me doing out here y'all. I'm literally going different places along with coming here to find out where the money is going and why there's so many homeless people out here on the street And the assessment that I've come to a conclusion and made over an almost two-year period is this: Grant funds from the 2023 National Sexual Assault Kid Initiative Grant in the amount not to exceed 37,000 to support overtime for PPP detectives For the investigation of old sexual assault cases. Really, How old are they? That's the million dollar question. How old are these sexual assault cases that you need 37,000 for Because it's too many people out on the street? I'm not playing with y'all. We're going to assess where this money is going And when we do, God is the one that's going to take action And he's going to force y'all to help these people on the street. Don't believe it? Just watch An increase from the 2025 capital budget: 63,333. 30 to account for additional Federal Highway Administration funding being received by the City of Pittsburgh. Really, That's the increase. It's the increase part that's getting my attention and I hope is getting the attention of everybody else: These increases. what you guys are doing is you're going on vacation with these increases of money And it's just not going to happen. I'm so sorry That's coming to an end. Proverbs 21. 13 says Those who shut their ears to the cries of the poor will be ignored in their own time of need. And I promise you y'all, get ready to come out here with us and see what it's really like The be all, the be all The be out on the street. You're not going to like it. I promise you you're not, And you're not going to have the grace to handle it when you lose everything and have to come out here with us. It's not going to be pretty. An eager anticipation of the Lord's return keeps us living productively In Jesus' name, amen, Thank you, Thank you. Are there any further speakers? No, Any further speakers.

Bill 7. 0, Airline 8 of 9 2017. 8, 17, Thirteen Deferred Paper resolution authorizing the Mayor and the Director of the Department of Public Works to enter into an agreement and or amendments, with the University of Pittsburgh for the purpose of providing supplemental waste operations in the Oakland neighborhood at no cost to the city. I have an amendment, So motion to amend. Second Discussion: The amendment 19. 17. I think. so, yeah, motion to approve. be free. motion to amend. oh, apologies. motion to approve second and then motion to amend. to amend: we have a second, second, second discussion on the proposed amendment i. i, if the director and supervisor here, i'd like to call them up, thank you. thank you, chris hornstein, director of public works. sean weigel, superintendent environmental services. thank you guys for being here. can we talk a little bit about what we're looking at here? yeah, absolutely so. this is to help fund a supplemental collection in oakland. so we've been working with the university of pittsburgh and they have agreed to a maximum of 15 additional collections in oakland to support the cleanliness of the neighborhood. so we've been working with the university to pick up additional trash. this was work that the university was trying to do themselves but it created a lot of confusion. it wasn't necessarily effective as we would have liked. so they have agreed to fund this on a per collection event basis to cover the city's costs to do additional pickup in the neighborhood. okay, do we know when those 15 supplemental pickups will be, or is it just as needed as needed? truly, we see the biggest amount of trash when the students move back in in the fall, sure? so trying to get everything in place, perhaps with tolerate- you, you know, doesn't sound like a lot like nation. all right, good, because no one's making it rightin. yes and no question. thank you for that. or is there something? the one thing the Mayors are isaders or that the students must know is that they really want to be from the visitors side because certain of the behavior is allowed to take breakfast, what like trend you've talked about? during the event, I wanted to keep my miles or chill for a long five steps. we don't want it in the context. perhaps we will do one shortly when we have the smaller amount, but definitely to be ready to go for when the kids move back in. Cool, Are we doing anything? I know that there have been efforts to get dumpsters placed on the street during move-in, when the- you know August 1st, when that move-in happens, that we've looked in the past of just staging dumpsters all throughout. Have we considered that again? or is that My understanding? there was too much abuse with that program that the intended purpose of it was not happening. Folks were coming in and filling the dumpsters before the residents could even use them. We've tried some different options since then and this is where we're at now. Okay, Well, I'm really glad to see this happen. I think this is, you know, really something that we need to see more of, You know. I also know that the university is paying, you know, a good bit for this. This is not a small expense for the university. You know, when they were going to do this with a private contractor, it was a lot cheaper. So I'm glad to see that they're willing to pony up and do this, you know, an extra 15 times, And I'm hoping that we see a lot of success out of this and, looking forward to it, To a cleaner Oakland. So, Thank you, Awesome Thanks guys. Councilwoman Kale-Smith, I just real briefly. I just wanted to mention that I actually was- I apologize, it was late. I was actually meeting with Kevin Quigley about red up stuff and trying to understand a little bit about what they did differently, And one of the things we talked about is maybe putting some of the trash collections instead of the alleys in Sheridan. You see that they're- I mean they're- constantly overflowed with trash, Is maybe just moving the trash to the front again of the homes. So I didn't know if that was something we could look into. I don't know, I don't know if that's something we can look into and see. do some kind of, you know, observation or pilot program to see if it works better, that there'd be less trash on those streets. But Sheridan does their own you know trash program that they have and they do an amazing job. but they shouldn't have to. They really shouldn't have to. But one of the things I keep getting requests for repeatedly is additional trash cans on Grandview Avenue. And is that your decision or whose decision would that be? You know we, we have a protocol in place to evaluate those. that involves, you know, 500. nothing like those falls off the streets are something that they can always help them. but also If, if there are too many problems, when there's an æ STOP disappeared, theène şuShift tests in the community, and that's not going to get any Dracula, so it's not going to get healedlers required. So some concernscych. I see some concerns. you know, Mr Olsen, Is there any rules to start iavel sowie funein tree ding ohi? No, i thank you for working on that with the police. i'm glad that something's you know happening, at least you're aware of it, and and i'm hoping that it's resolved soon. but i just in general, i mean it's- i just feel like we need to like sit back and try to figure out what we could do differently, what did work, what didn't work, and i think that there's a lot that that has worked in the past and i think you're doing a lot of things. i love the timers or the, you know the, the sensors on the, on the trash cans, i mean if they're working. but what i see: yesterday they did another cleanup of mcgardle roadway, which were also waiting- waiting for mcgardle roadway to be completed. that's a project domey's working on and i want to thank them for that. but i feel like all projects in my district are held up until the election or until until i'm out of office. but but it's unfair that the people are paying the price for that and and so they're paying the price with, you know, pools not opening, with playgrounds not getting done with trails, not being done, with trash all over the place, different things that i feel like. okay, they deserve to at least have some response. we all represent. we've, you know, every, we represent all the people, and so it just felt like we need to do a little bit better in those areas, regardless of- and every administration has done it i mean- so i mean every administration's had their projects they've held up, removed. but what i'm going to say is that for me, i would like to see more of an effort in terms of this, this area getting more attention. but i mean that stadium street over in sheridan. you know it's it's a lot of work, but i think it's a lot of work. but i think it's a lot of work. but i and the things that are happening over there and the illegal dumping- and i do want to thank you because you, you and domie, have been very responsive, i mean truthfully. but it shouldn't get to that point and it's my understanding it's. you know somebody who works for the city, it's their relative that's doing the dumping and people know who it is and they just keep it just keeps happening. so i just want to make sure that you're working on those issues that are quality of life issues for all of pittsburgh. i understand the importance of oakland. i was born and raised there. i mean still have a gazillion friends there and family. so i understand and appreciate and i want them to have that attention, but i also want to make sure that we're not forgetting about the other neighborhoods, thank you. thank you, councilman coghill. thank you, madam chair. morning chris, hey sean, how are you good? getting back to the oakland thing real quick, just out of curiosity. so what was happening was the university was taking it upon themselves to pick up trash from students. is that right? or a ballpark trash or something like that. and then then then we decided to say, hey, wait, that confusion was going on or whatnot, and we decided we should do it and they just pay us. is that summing up? that's it. last year they started working with a vendor. they already had to do something. i consider hiring somebody private to pick up, but it was again, yeah, uniformly just doesn't fit into and it wasn't nearly as effective as we believe our program would be. yeah, you know, we were still on the street and mayor receive information and others who visited us say those places were cleaning Delhi and area not. there had been the same issues on the street that anybody in the public right away would encounter. you know, large piles of recycling and waste during moving periods, blocking sidewalks, that sort of thing. you know, it just wasn't being as effective as i think we all would have hoped. do you know if, if they are paying us as much as they were paying the private vendor, or how did? i'm not previous. yes, i'm not perfect to the amounts that they were paying. yes, i'm not perfect to the system. i'd need to, i thinkcel the private vendor. yeah, right, but councilmanny carlin said: you know pretty much the same way and hopefully others have to change that idea and you know, have some connectivity issues, that sort of thing, which we do all have a perfect group of folks we'd stop meeting and i'll tell you what you call. one or one in the high school know pretty much it's worth our while. whatever they're paying us, it's not, they're paying for our labor. i guess, how do you calculate what they pay? just like we do in wilkinsburg. do we pick up wilkinsburg? yeah, yes, yeah. so again, this is the cover, the city's cost, cover, the cost that we would already be doing if we weren't part. right, right, okay, okay. now shifting to issue that, i don't know if you would even consider something like this, but, like councilman kiel smith said, i'm always about garbage cans. i'd love to have them every corner. honestly i would. i think people use them if you put them out. but if there's a law and they throw it on the ground, it's unfortunate, but that's kind of the way it is. so you know, i've been taking up on myself to pick up, clean up- you know, getting volunteers to clean up sides of roads and things of that nature, but most specifically it was the entrance to the liberty tubes, okay, and you know what a mess that was. it was just just the point of the road and the road was just a mess and it was just a mess horrible. got it all cleaned up. i developed a rapport with the people, kind of hang out there. so you know they know what i expect out of them. they're asking for a garbage can, right, because they're putting their. now i don't weigh in on whether it's right or not for them to be their panhandling, that's, if we're going to allow it as a city, that's fine by me. i just don't want syringes there and i don't want them leaving their garbage behind. you're not going to be told them that. and they've said and they've started actually to put their- you know- trash in one spot, for me at least. but you know, they drink, they beverages, they eat. people give them food. there's garbage that accumulates. so, as crazy as it sounds, can we get them a garbage can underneath the liberty to ceremony? certainly, we'll talk to our staff to see what we can do about that. yeah, because, because i think that would help. as far as my eye goes, when i see a loaf of bread or you know something, laying on the ground there- unsanitary, you know, i'm just like, oh god, so you know. and then if we're gonna again, if we're gonna allow them to be there every morning, afternoon and do what they do, i'm not, i don't object to that, i object, i don't want the garbage there. i don't want needle, hypodermic needles there. if that's the case, i want them out, you know so. so if i, if you would entertain that, i think no, absolutely, yeah, okay, appreciate that, thanks, that's it for me, madam chair. thank you, councilman. are there any further questions? if not, i have a couple myself. anyone online? okay, thank you. first i want to thank you for arranging this arrangement. it's great and it's much needed, and although i don't see the exact same volume of these kind of move out issues right around the part of oakland that i represent as much as council person. charlotte, it's definitely noticeable. we know it's been an issue every year. opdc and pitt have tried- you know numerous different strategies and so i'm glad this is happening. and i also want to thank you, director, for making the time, taking the time to call each of the council members in oakland to give us a heads up about this and allow us to ask our own questions about this. so i don't think i have too many questions, only to say that i think what we discussed was looking at this to see if we can learn something, whether we can apply it to other neighborhoods. i mean, of course, i'm sure that you know it's it's a, it's a, it's a. it's a difficult decision to make, but i do believe it would be okay. you know i could not ask out a lot more. i mean like, yeah, i'm definitely grateful that we can support it, but i think it's really important to add on a lot of these things just to how one might think that downtown, with what we call an offense boxes- i don't know as a community- can be had on right without treasurables for those issues. and you know, i think to t ending as a publicstal of a process that could be combined in this project- is role will always stay in one place, on the land and the level of works that you would like to see. so it's not a law firm that who will be the first to deal with theimer. can you just answer that question? okay, there's so much more to consider, but i think this, this collector, also works as a part of Great. My question is: the amendment moves from like a discrete number of 15 occasions- 3,000 per event- to actual costs incurred. What was the reason for that change? And I know we said it'll be cost incurred. We don't really know until we do it, but do we have a rough estimate of what that'll be? Is it still going to be roughly 3,000 per pickup or total or anything more? Yes, it will roughly be, no less than I think there's some additional costs with recycling and landfill that don't get incurred until after we get invoiced by RecycleSource, And so those costs fluctuate based on the market, But certainly all the costs of our labor, the cost of our equipment, same with the landfill. We're in the process of renegotiating a landfill contract, so we anticipate those costs, which is the other reason for the amendment because we realized that like, hey, there's a good potential, There's a potential for us to have an increased cost of everything captured there. So we just want to have the flexibility to work with the university to realize those. Okay, Thank you, Any further discussion? Second round. Councilwoman Kale-Smith, Just briefly, I do want to thank you, Supervisor, for all the work that you do and Director, for all the work you do across the Pittsburgh. Your institutional knowledge really means a lot And I know that when I send you stuff and how you address it and how you handle it and the responses you give. So I just want to thank you. Thank you, Councilman Coghill. Thank you, Madam Chair. I usually complain, but I'm not, you know, honestly. I want to also back up Councilwoman Kale-Smith. Yeah, the job you do, Shawn, honestly, is phenomenal. I get very, very few phone calls, complaints on refuge. you know, and you've been really great about sending public works by when we do these cleanups and you know they've come in and hauled it out. So I really do appreciate all the work you do. So thank you. Thank you, Further discussion, Councilperson Warwick. Since we're talking about it, what is the? what's the lifespan of these city, of the city blue bins that we give out. Oh, yes, I mean roughly, We really haven't got there yet. Okay, Certainly, we've just finally got them all to our residence. We do have a warranty on them. So if there are things that break, things like that, we can get them replaced. Okay, You know, you're typically, you know, five, ten years behind. Okay, So maybe it just depends on the condition of use, I guess, Okay, I just next time we do, like next time it comes around, I think, the clams. I just watched one of your crews even throwing it in the truck. it looks easier Because it's like they don't have to take it off or whatever. they just- and you know it's closed and then they just do it. It'd be great to give those to residents for both the regular trash and for the recycle. Do we give regular trash? No, No, We should do it. No, be here for that, okay, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, But the lids kind of warp a little bit. Yeah, Anyway, At the time that was the best option. Sure, sure, sure, You can always look to improve. Yeah, Anyway, that's it, thanks, Thank you. All right, so we have a proposed amendment on the table.

And then also thanks to the team Pittsburgh deck hockey group, because it's it's probably the most vibrant area in Brighton Heights. they're the concession stand open for the whole community and, you know, really brings a lot of people out in the neighborhood. So thanks everyone, Thank you. Any further discussion? Councilman Kales, I just want to say to Councilman Wilson that my grandkids play over that way and I sometimes go to the fields to watch them play and they look at me like I'm a stranger in his territory and I shouldn't be there.

What do you think they just saw in the knick-knackers, in the Millers, the Judges making their key statement? He was totally radical. He is complicated.
