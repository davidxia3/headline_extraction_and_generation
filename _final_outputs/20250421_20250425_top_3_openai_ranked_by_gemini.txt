Headline 1: Council holds public hearing and advances bill to reduce minimum lot sizes in residential zoning districts
Summary 1: - The City Council held a public hearing on Bill 1579, which aims to reduce minimum lot size requirements across Pittsburgh’s residential zoning districts to encourage more housing development and affordability.  
- The bill lowers minimum lot sizes as follows:  
  - Very Low-Density: from 8,000 to 6,000 sq. ft.  
  - Low-Density: from 5,000 to 3,000 sq. ft.  
  - Moderate Density: from 3,200 to 2,400 sq. ft.  
  - High Density: from 1,800 to 1,200 sq. ft.  
  - Very High Density: removes minimum lot size entirely.  
- It also eliminates minimum lot size per unit requirements, which currently restrict multi-unit housing development, especially duplexes and triplexes.  
- The reform addresses a major barrier where many existing lots (up to over 50% in some districts) do not meet current minimum lot sizes, making many homes technically illegal and new development difficult without variances.  
- Supporters emphasized that the bill would legalize many existing homes, allow more modest and affordable housing types, increase housing supply, and promote walkability and transit use.  
- The bill is based on recommendations from the 2022 Housing Needs Assessment and has been vetted through extensive public engagement and planning commission approval without conditions.  
- Several speakers urged passing this bill quickly to address Pittsburgh’s housing crisis, while also calling for the full comprehensive zoning package—including inclusionary zoning and parking reforms—to be adopted together for maximum impact.  
- Some opponents expressed concerns about potential neighborhood crowding, gentrification, and the piecemeal approach of separating this bill from the full zoning reform package.  
- Councilmembers sponsoring the bill highlighted the need to move forward with this “clean fix” now to unlock vacant lots, reduce red tape, and align zoning with the city’s historic built environment.  
- The hearing concluded with broad council support to advance the bill while acknowledging ongoing debates about the broader housing reform package.

Headline 2: Council schedules special meeting to address EMS, fire, and police fleet issues
Summary 2: - Councilman Coghill called for a special post-agenda meeting focused on the condition of the EMS, fire, and police vehicle fleets due to recent ambulance breakdowns during emergency calls.  
- The last full fleet review was two years ago, and little progress has been made in funding or repairs since then.  
- Coghill emphasized the urgency of addressing life-saving equipment failures and plans to hear directly from department directors about the current state of their fleets.  
- Council President and other members supported scheduling the meeting as soon as possible, ideally next week, citing public safety risks and the need for transparent discussion.  
- The council agreed unanimously to hold this focused session to explore solutions and necessary investments to ensure reliable emergency response vehicles.

Headline 3: Council holds Bill 1736 on paid sick leave accrual rates for public hearing
Summary 3: - Council held Bill 1736, which proposes changes to the Pittsburgh Paid Sick Days Act, for a public hearing rather than voting on it immediately.  
- The bill would increase the rate at which employees accrue paid sick leave and raise the maximum hours they can accumulate annually.  
- For employers with 15 or more employees, sick leave accrual is set at 1 hour per 30 hours worked, with a maximum of 72 hours per year.  
- For employers with fewer than 15 employees, the maximum accrual is 48 hours per year under the same accrual rate.  
- The ordinance would take effect on January 1, 2026.  
- Council President Lavelle requested the bill be held for public input before final approval.  
- The motion to hold the bill for a public hearing passed unanimously.
