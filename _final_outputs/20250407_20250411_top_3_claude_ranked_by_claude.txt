Summary 1: • Pittsburgh reported 17 traffic deaths in 2024, down from 20 in 2023 and 24 in 2022 — the first year results of the city's Vision Zero program

• The city averages 20 deaths and 123 serious injuries from crashes each year, with the goal of reducing both to zero

• Vision Zero launched in March 2024 when Mayor Gainey and Council Member Warwick passed legislation creating an interdepartmental working group

• The program includes four main committees:
  - **Enforcement**: Working on automated red light cameras (currently selecting vendors) and education programs with police and neighborhood councils
  - **Budget**: Secured millions in funding for traffic safety projects and improved grant application processes  
  - **Education and Communications**: Created safety pledges for students, community ambassador programs, and safe driver training for city staff
  - **Fatal Crash Response Team**: Conducts site visits within two weeks of every fatal crash using standardized data collection

• The Fatal Crash Response Team completed 6 site visits in 2024 and 4 so far in 2025, making quick safety improvements like better signage and road markings

• State roads make up only 12% of city streets but account for nearly half (44-48%) of all crashes each year

• Upcoming goals include a Vision Zero summit in fall 2025, expanding crash response work to serious injuries, and creating a community toolkit for residents to make their own traffic safety improvements

• Pittsburgh joins other Pennsylvania cities like Philadelphia, Bethlehem, Harrisburg, and Lancaster in adopting Vision Zero strategies
