Headline 1: City Council places a five-week hold on a $1.5 million contract with Auberle for shelter services.
Summary 1: - City Council voted to delay a decision on a $1.5 million contract with the nonprofit Auberle for five weeks.
- The contract would use federal HOME-ARP funds to provide non-congregate, or individual, shelter services.
- The delay is needed to resolve a "lack of communication" between city and county officials, who had conflicting plans for who would be housed in the proposed shelter.
- A new approval process must now take place, which will include a public meeting and a 15-day comment period.
- Councilmembers noted that while they had previously hoped the funds could be used for a tiny house community, federal rules for this funding source make that difficult.

Summary 2: - City Council approved a $37,000 grant to help investigate old sexual assault cases and improve facilities for victims.
- The funds come from the National Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, with the money being passed to the city through Allegheny County.
- The grant provides $36,000 to pay for police overtime. This will cover the work of pulling untested sexual assault kits from the property room, writing reports, and sending them to the crime lab for analysis.
- The remaining $1,000 will be used to create a "soft interview room."
- A police commander explained that current interview rooms are cold and sterile. The new room will have a couch and softer furnishings to create a more comfortable environment for victims to tell their stories.
