**Section of meeting transcript:**
bill number 1668 resolution reappointing Janet Evans as a member of the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh Board of Directors with a term to expire December 31st 2029. Thank you For the record. we're joined by. We're joined by Councilwoman Strasburger as well as Councilwoman Warwick. At this point I'll turn it over to Ms Giles. Maybe if you would just introduce yourself, tell us a little bit about yourself, why you're excited to be a part of the Clean Pittsburgh Commission. Sure, My name is Affling Giles. I've worked for the city for going on 15 years. I started off as a sustainability coordinator in the mayor's office and have worked my way up to being the principal planner of sustainability and resilience for the city of Pittsburgh. One of the wonderful things that I've had the opportunity to do is to be part of the Clean Pittsburgh Commission, which was actually it started off being literally a part of my job, but it was a pleasure to do and to serve on this commission. We've helped to make sure that the city of Pittsburgh stays clean and is in as good a condition as we can. It's a primarily voluntary opportunity by people not only in the city, within the city of Pittsburgh that work very diligently At waste, but also with a lot of wonderful volunteers from outside of local government that also volunteer their time and their talents in order to help make sure that the city can try to be as clean as possible. I served for the last two terms as the Clean Pittsburgh Commission's treasurer, So I helped to make sure that all of our fundings, our funds- are being spent And I'm just happy to continue that. Thank you very much. I'll turn it over to Ms Evans if there's anything you would like to say about your reappointment to the Housing Authority. I'm excited. I've been on the board for a long time And I was able to make a lot of changes for a lot of residents As well as the workers, Especially if they needed new phones or new cars. But that was like in the first couple of years of me being on the board. I just don't think of my own area, But I think of the Housing Authority all around, And I would like to be reappointed. The reason is I'm there for the residents that help make changes And I want to see what the future is going to be for them. So I represent a lot of people on the Housing Authority, Thank you, And I want to be not just my own area, but everybody. I'm going to hold this for you because we can't hear. I'm sorry. Do you want me to hold it? I can do that, You can. No, you can't hear me. You want me to start from the beginning. Well, I think we heard you, But those listening, Those listening outside of chambers, may not have heard you. So you don't have to start from the beginning. I would say: continue where you were, Okay. So a lot of people that I have talked to outside of the Housing Authority- It's very rare for people like myself to have a disability but can get around. I was involved. I was involved. I was involved In a couple of organizations, like the Access Task Force for many years. Actually, I'm one of the founders of Access When they started the program. the pilot program was started in 1970. Oh, yeah, Yeah, In 1978, And then it went through to 1979, When Access is a transportation helping people with disabilities and seniors get out of their homes and do what we all want to do, Like shopping, visiting, going to school and meetings. That's what Access. Also, I was- I still am- on the Port Authority. I was on the bus And I was one of the ones who tested out the ramps. Well, at first it was the lift and then the ramps, And I told them what was what. I just want to make sure you understand. I wasn't the only one that was part of these Committees, But I have helped a lot of them to understand and also reason why we should do certain things. I don't demand, I don't argue, I just try to reason with everybody And get my point across. So any questions of me. Thank you, I will turn it over to members if they have questions for either of our guests. Councilwoman Wood. Sure, Yeah, All right. So, Afton, I'll start with you. So we have actually been talking a lot about litter. It's Something that is a big problem in the city of Pittsburgh And I'm curious- Well, to be honest, I'm actually Curious kind of- about the role of the Clean Pittsburgh Commission. It's not a commission that I am actually super familiar with, Although I am going to be on your next meeting talking about some Trying to get some funding for in school programming with PPS. But Yeah, So I'd be, I'd be curious to understand, To sort of hear your thoughts on what? Well, a few things, One sort of the educational side. Right, I know that we- You know today I'm Allegheny Cleanways- is going to be in Greenfield School talking to the sixth graders. You know how can we can do more of that sort of that That You know, Starting at the young age, education Efforts Around the city and then also Some of these issues that were that we talked about yesterday at Council. you know Penn dot not, you know not keeping their roads clean, Our issues with you know, legal issues with You know, illegal dumping and and dealing with properties that are not you know, where folks are just leaving their properties full of garbage and just Anyway, it's kind of open ended. but Yeah, So I'm curious to hear what the Commission can help address those things or advise us on how to how to help address those things. So the Commission's been around for a while, because before there was a Commission there really wasn't. It wasn't a ton other than, you know, a group of people that were sort of volunteering their time to talk about these issues. So the Commission was formed because they wanted a way to elevate it beyond just a group of, you know, concerned citizens, And so we're really excited about that, And so I think that the Commission has been really involved in that. So I think that the Commission is really committed to making it something more official. Over the years it has has transitioned. at first we had no budget within the last Maybe ten years. We finally do have a budget, An official budget, And a lot of that Is is dependent on In terms of how those funds are spent. It's dependent on a lot of different programs. Some, some of it is informed by Council, One of the. The other thing that we have is a community of focus where a lot of the people that serve on the Council are also members of, like Allegheny Clean Waste, PRC and some of the other other nonprofits within the city of Pittsburgh that particularly deal with waste, and they deal with waste on on a on an annual basis. We also have, you know, a lot of the people from the city as well, from DPW, myself, from sustainability, where you know Council and members of the community, you know, let us know where some of the pockets are happening And so they. we have a lot of different ways. So that's what we've been doing with regards to legal dumping And some of the other litter. So we- The committee of focus tends to travel From different communities. we've done Homewood, We've done the hill district, we've done Hazelwood. I think we're moving into the west end this year- Just trying to do what we can to try to make sure that some of the litter that are in those places Get cleaned up. But there's only so much that we can do, Unfortunately, because Thirty thousand dollars does not go very far, So and the litter keeps coming. So some of the educational things that we have done, especially with illegal dumping, has been to work with some of the local magistrate judges to let them know how it impacts communities. There's a lot of cases where, you know, we go through the process of cleaning it up, we go through the process of siting a place, we go through the process of even having the cameras to catch the person that actually did the illegal dumping, and then they get to, you know, to the part where it's time for them to have some sort of sentencing and they either get a slap on the wrist or it's forgiven And it's like, well, you know, we put in a lot of time, we put in a lot of effort for a person to be able to walk away. It sort of undermines some of the process that we do. basically, For a while we only had one person working on enforcement for the entire city for illegal dumping. I believe within the last year we've actually hired two, because the person that was doing it retired after many years of service. But it's a very slow process and I think it's something that we really have to work together on more to make sure that the system's not broken, so that the time that is put into cleaning it up, the time that's in a lot of it, like I said, is volunteer-led. Even the nonprofits that work on it- you know they have one or two staff people and the rest of the people who are helping to clean up are actually volunteers- to be able to put more resources behind actually helping people to be able to afford to take the time to do this and to be able to take it seriously, not only from the cleanup portion of it, all the way through to making sure it doesn't keep reoccurring. So that's definitely one way that we could work together on trying to make sure that the cycle isn't as broken as it is currently. basically, We also work on things like composting. One of the things that we've identified is that you know, we need some sort of a regional waste strategy. The people from the commission have helped work with me to help to inform the process of and some of the grant funding that we've applied to so that we can try to get that going, so that we can do a zero waste plan, not only for the city of Pittsburgh but for actually Allegheny County as a region. So those are some of the other things that you know me being on the council and having their help and having their ear has also helped to inform us as a city too. So those are some of the a few of the things I'm curious about your thoughts. So I mean one thing- and you know it sounds simple, but of course it's never simple- but you know is I would kind of love to see DPW treat litter the same way that we treat snow and weeds right As sort of like, or in potholes right as like a seasonal thing, where, at this time of the year when the. you know when the snow is gone and the leaves are gone and we can really see it. that you know. I know that that is not so. I understand that the environmental services team has this gold plan where essentially it would be like a dedicated crew And then there's- but there's challenges with that as well, just in terms of hiring and you know location, like where does that crew sit? I don't do. has the commission kind of looked at these options or have any recommendations? So the gold plan was one of the things that the commission helped to put together. So the person who actually wrote the gold plan was on the Clean Pittsburgh Commission for, as the city representative from DPW for many years. So that's sort of one of the things that actually came out of the commission was the gold plan for litter, because we knew how much of an issue it actually was. So one of the things that, like I said, and that you mentioned, is resourcing it basically so that DPW has the staff who can put the time towards actually doing that. If I'm sure you are aware that the litter problem in Pittsburgh- I'm sure you are aware that the litter problem in Pittsburgh is that you have to have a lot of people doing it. You have to have a lot of people doing it, And that's, I think, one of the things that we're seeing at the moment is that the city has a lot of people doing it, And I think that the number of people doing it at the moment in Pittsburgh is almost chronic, And not only inside of the actual city core, but along a lot of the edges of the city and along our riverfronts especially, And that causes other problems that lead into some of the combined sewer overflow issues that we have, Just because of the trash that gets washed away and gets stuck in the places that the water is supposed to be going down. it causes huge problems. So those are some of the things that really need an actual staff person and actual crew, actual crew put towards so that they can actually have the time to put towards those resources, because a lot of the same people that are doing the same work of helping to do some of the other infrastructure take care of some of the other infrastructure parts of Pittsburgh are also the same people that are also tasked with litter, And it's a little difficult when you don't have enough people to do it, to do all the different things, especially if some other things take priority. So those are some of the things that we would love to talk to you guys about to try to figure out if there's a way that we can get the dedicated personnel- I mean environmental services- you're talking about only maybe about four or five people that are doing that are literally moving mountains on a daily basis because they not only manage some of the litter issues but they're also managing picking up waste every single day from the 300,000 households that we have within the city. Well, that's interesting. So the commission is saying It's the gold plan, That's what we need to do is have the dedicated team. I personally feel like if we were picking up litter regularly and also being a little more regular about citing, for example, businesses that have litter in front of their business, that once you start to clean it up, it kind of continues. I completely agree. That's good to know. I mean, that's something for us to consider when budgeting, When budget season rolls on. I know it's something that I've been asking for for a while. Yeah, I think there was an effort initially to kind of have DPW crews do it, but it didn't work out because it was like there's always something It takes priority. There's a pothole or there's something like causing a block in the roadway or whatever. There were things that just unfortunately, in terms of urgency, like rise above litter, But it's frustrating because we can't rely on volunteers- It's just not. It's not reasonable, It's not sustainable. I mean, I pick up litter in my own neighborhood and it's like you do it and then two weeks later it's It's back. It blows back One quick. And this is again- I know this is maybe something that I've heard from some residents and I feel like I've noticed myself- is: do you have thoughts about this change from the recycling to no bags in the? Because I feel like I have noticed on recycle days there's a lot. I don't know if it's blowing out of the cans or what, but I don't know if the commission has. But I also understand that the bags muck up the machinery. Yes, So I think that getting rid of the bags was the right way to go. I've actually had the unique opportunity to actually go visit some of the recycling center, maybe about five or six years ago. I'm that old in city years, So I've had a chance to actually go into the plant and see how it works and seeing how it's working, And I think that's really what I've learned- I think that's the first thing that I've learned- is that you can't just go into the recycling center and just go in and see what's going on. You have to go in and see what's going on, And I think that's really what I've learned, And I think that's the first thing that I've learned is that it's not detrimental having that bag, that plastic bags, being broken and literally mucking up their operations to where they have to shut down, clean up all the equipment before they can start processing again. And the first level of the recycling system is not only breaking those bags, but then you have people that are on that first piece, that are actually sifting through the waste and having to try to pick out tiny pieces of plastic, because it gets jammed up, it gets melted as part and part of the equipment and it's just. It creates a horrible mess. I think one of the things that we could do better is to do enforcement in terms of making sure that people actually have lids and are using those lids on their waste, Because a lot of what ends up happening, like you said, is people have open trash- whether it's trash or recycling, they're not using the lids. the lids aren't secured. The lids on the recycling bins actually lock. You push them down and they actually do have sort of a locking mechanism in them And then to help to keep that waste in and contained. I mean, we have wind in Pittsburgh, It's a thing. It blows the trash everywhere, it blows the waste everywhere. So I think even just starting at the first level of just having the appropriate amount of staffing to be able to do the enforcement part of it and then following through the enforcement process from ticketing to actually the finding portion of it, I think would go a long way to help with some of that as well as helping to clean up the pockets, Because some of the litter that we have isn't just a person not caring, Some of it is you know, I put my trash out, the wind came and it started blowing it everywhere, Or it knocked over the trash can and then it starts rolling down the hill or whatever. So I think that making sure that people have those lids on there are using them appropriately, and then the enforcement to make sure that trash is not just sat open in boxes and things like that, I think will go a long way as well. And, like you said, education is really also key to make sure that people are also recycling correctly And that people are putting things in the trash correctly as well. I mean, we do have the policies, It's just a matter of making sure that they're followed through. in some cases, Yeah, yeah, The lids, I don't know, My lids buckle. I don't know about other, It's sort of hindsight's 20-20, but I like those attached clamshell lids.

Aye, I do have a question about this, if there's someone present. Thanks. Should be a pretty quick and easy question, but feel free to introduce yourself, Patrick Cornell, Chief Financial Officer. Thank you. So forgive me for not looking into this further beforehand, but I know that if all goes well, we'll have a citywide LED lighting project completed. Is this the same type of lighting, Is it different, Or is this just going to help defray the cost of that in some way? That is a good question. I don't have that answer off the top of my head. My understanding is that this is different and separate from the street light project as a whole. But I do not have the answer, but I can get it. Okay, I see Director Lucas here. We can put her on the spotlight immediately if she knows the answer, Really. Okay. So this is related to Penn Avenue Lighting Project. I don't know if you can come in. Ooh, a little tech lag between the third floor and the fourth floor. Yes, yes, And I will use this opportunity to say: we realize that there has been a. there are some technical issues. We believe it is a Zoom update issue, but we're not sure. But you should be able to watch it via cable on YouTube right now. even if it's not, the Zoom isn't completely working correctly. So apologies to everyone, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Okay, So I'm going to turn it over to the next one who might be tuning in, And I also see Councilwoman Gross raising her hand, So maybe we'll start with an interrogatory there and then see if the question's answered. Oh no, you want to sorry, sorry, sorry, Yes, please. You don't want to answer. You want to ask your own question, Please. So my question is Director Lucas. Penn Avenue Lighting. it's uncontroversial. It's a grant proposal for 461. This is Bill 1689 Mm-hmm For the Penn Avenue Lighting Project. Okay, Which is great. You know, no issue always looking for more funding. I was just curious if this is to defray the cost of the LED streetlight, Like if this is the same kind of lighting as the citywide LED project, or how is this distinct and like? why is this separate then from that whole project? Sure, It's an opportunity to enhance that particular business district with additional lighting, like we see in some other corridors, for safety and economic development purposes. So it will go to support. So it's a great opportunity to do that. And then, if we can't support our project, we didn't want to necessarily divert funds from our base level lighting designs that we have citywide And this was in partnership with the East Liberty Corridor. Chamber of Commerce Got it. So this is an enhancement, Okay, Mm-hmm, Thank you. That's all I had. Council Member Gross, Thank you. Penn Avenue is a very, very long corridor right from downtown to the edge of the city, So I was kind of wondering which part of the project this is. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Okay, So this is for an eight-block stretch and it'll include 96 lights in the main business corridor. It's from Spirit at the busway to Negley, So mostly District 9 with— Spirit Street. Spirit Street at the busway through Negley- Yes, Mostly District 9 with the one block— See right back at the —part in District 8 that Scott McMurtry has so graciously reminded us is part of District 8. Okay, Got it. So the East Liberty Business District. That was my question. That's all, Thank you. Thank you. Any further questions? discussion? Councilman Mosley, I just want to thank Domi for your partnership. I was on those emails and I think in an initial meeting we had upstairs to pull together the Chamber of Commerce and the other stakeholders within the East Liberty Business District. So it's good to see this move forward and thank you for your partnership. Thank you, All right Seeing. no further discussion. all those in favor of Bill 1689, please indicate by saying aye, Aye, Opposed, Opposed Abstentions: Affirmative recommendation. Thank you both.

The grant proposal includes an ask of 461,856 for this stated purpose, to accept the grant, reduce the grant amount and authorize necessary expenditures. Motion to approve Second Discussion. Aye, I do have a question about this, if there's someone present. Thanks. Should be a pretty quick and easy question, but feel free to introduce yourself, Patrick Cornell, Chief Financial Officer. Thank you.
Penn Avenue Lighting. it's uncontroversial. It's a grant proposal for 461. This is Bill 1689 Mm-hmm For the Penn Avenue Lighting Project. Okay, Which is great. You know, no issue always looking for more funding. I was just curious if this is to defray the cost of the LED streetlight, Like if this is the same kind of lighting as the citywide LED project, or how is this distinct and like? why is this separate then from that whole project? Sure, It's an opportunity to enhance that particular business district with additional lighting, like we see in some other corridors, for safety and economic development purposes. So it will go to support. So it's a great opportunity to do that. And then, if we can't support our project, we didn't want to necessarily divert funds from our base level lighting designs that we have citywide And this was in partnership with the East Liberty Corridor. Chamber of Commerce Got it. So this is an enhancement, Okay, Mm-hmm, Thank you.
