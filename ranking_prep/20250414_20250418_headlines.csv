- The purchaser claims the house deteriorated during the sale process.
  - The sale process—which includes a quiet title lawsuit—typically takes 12–18 months but can extend to 24 months.
- Properties sold by the City are primarily vacant lots acquired through sheriff’s sales.
- Buyers must be approved by the City, and sales must be approved by Council.
- Councilmember Coghill expressed concern about the length of the process and the lack of property stabilization.
- The refund was approved with no next steps proposed.","• Council approved rescinding a property sale and refunding a $4,000 deposit to a buyer who backed out after the house deteriorated during a lengthy approval process

• The property at 136 Bodkin Street was priced at $40,000, with the buyer putting down $4,000 as required hand money in 2022

• The sale process took over 24 months instead of the typical 12-18 months, during which time the roof developed large holes and the property became uninhabitable

• City staff opposed the refund, warning it could set a dangerous precedent and drain the three taxing bodies trust fund, which recently became profitable after years of losses

• However, Council Budget Director revealed the city has refunded deposits at least twice in the past three years, making this not unprecedented

• The finance department has dramatically improved property sales, moving over 250 properties in 2023 compared to just 24 in 2019

• Most city-owned properties (95% of about 10,000) are vacant lots, with only a few hundred having structures

• The buyer had the right to inspect the property before purchasing but would have been locked into the contract regardless of deterioration during the approval process

• Several council members abstained due to legal concerns, while others supported the refund on principle

• The three taxing bodies trust fund now has over $1 million after previously operating in the red and requiring city subsidies","- A City Council committee recommended canceling the sale of a city-owned house at 136 Bodkin Street and refunding the buyer's $4,000 deposit.

- The buyer had agreed to purchase the property for $40,000 but wanted to back out after the sale process took over two years, far longer than the 12 to 18 months initially estimated.

- During the delay, the house deteriorated significantly, with a large hole developing in the roof that was visible from the street.

- Councilmember Anthony Coghill, the bill's sponsor, argued that while the buyer caused some delays, the city's slow process and the property's worsening condition made keeping the deposit unfair.

- The city’s Finance Department argued against the refund, stating that sales agreements require buyers to forfeit their deposit if they back out. They warned that making an exception would set a bad financial precedent that could hurt the fund used for property sales.

- Council staff pointed out that the city has approved similar refunds at least twice in the past three years, questioning whether this was a new precedent.

- The full council will take a final vote on the resolution.","- The City Council approved Resolution No. 254 to rescind the sale of 136 Bodkin Street, originally authorized in Resolution No. 512 of 2022, and to refund the $4,000 hand money paid by the buyer, Parys Durham, for the $40,000 property.
- The sale was delayed over two years, exceeding the typical 12-18 month timeline, during which the property deteriorated significantly, including a large hole in the roof.
- Councilman Coghill highlighted concerns about the city’s slow process and the need for better property stabilization to prevent such deterioration.
- The hand money is usually non-refundable after council approval and once the city incurs costs like quiet title fees, but exceptions have been made twice before in recent years.
- The city treasurer and finance director explained that the hand money covers administrative and legal costs, and refunding it risks setting a costly precedent that could harm the Three Taxing Bodies (3TB) trust fund, which now holds over $1 million after years of losses.
- Legal counsel noted refunding hand money is unprecedented and could invite legal challenges, but no formal legal opinion was available yet; Council agreed to proceed with the refund on principle while seeking further legal review.
- The council discussed the importance of moving properties faster, improving communication with buyers, and using the land bank as a better tool for handling such sales and property stabilization.
- The property sale process includes vetting buyers, community input, and a quiet title process that can take up to a year or more, contributing to delays.
- Council members acknowledged the need for clearer policies and better tracking of costs to potentially allow partial refunds in the future, but emphasized protecting the city’s financial interests."

• The tunnels will be built about 150 feet below ground as part of ALCOSAN's larger regional tunnel system along the Ohio, Allegheny, and Monongahela Rivers

• The project helps ALCOSAN meet requirements from a 2008 federal consent decree to reduce combined sewer overflows by separating stormwater from the sanitary sewer system

• The affected properties are located in the West End near the former Pataglia dumping site and on the North Side under the West End Bridge

• Councilwoman Gross noted that future ALCOSAN legislation should include street addresses or geographic descriptions instead of just parcel numbers to help the public understand where projects are located

• The city will provide permanent underground easements to ALCOSAN, meaning the authority gets permanent rights to use the underground space for the tunnels

• This is part of a larger infrastructure project that will include renovations underneath the West End Bridge, similar to work done on the North Side","- The City Council approved giving the Allegheny County Sanitary Authority (ALCOSAN) permission to build permanent underground tunnels beneath nine city-owned properties.
- In exchange for the easements, the city will receive a one-time payment of $8,200.
- The tunnels are part of a larger, federally-mandated project to reduce sewer overflows into local rivers by separating stormwater from the sanitary sewer system.
