Headline 1: Pittsburgh Water pauses Four Mile Run and three other flood mitigation projects due to funding shortfalls.
Summary 1: • Pittsburgh Water announced it is pausing four flood mitigation projects citywide due to funding shortfalls, including the Four Mile Run project that has been in development for six years

• The paused projects are Four Mile Run, Stewart Avenue, MLK Field, and South Side Park - with Four Mile Run being the most critical due to severe flooding that fills the neighborhood with sewage when heavy rains occur

• Pittsburgh Water has spent $8.7 million on the Four Mile Run project design, which is now 90% complete, but needs an additional $30 million for construction

• The project lost $10 million in funding from Alcasan when green infrastructure elements (stream daylighting) were removed due to permitting challenges with the state and CSX railroad

• Pittsburgh Water's $1.2 billion capital improvement plan over five years prioritizes mandated projects like the Water Reliability Plan (30% of funding) and lead service line replacement over stormwater projects

• Recent improvements to the M-29 outfall may have helped reduce flooding, but Pittsburgh Water is conducting hydraulic modeling to confirm the impact since no major storms have occurred since 2021

• Army Corps of Engineers representatives outlined potential federal funding programs that could provide 75% reimbursement for flood mitigation work if Pittsburgh Water applies

• Council Member Warwick expressed frustration that residents who fought against the Mon Oakland Connector road project now see their flood project canceled, calling it a crisis of faith in government

• Pittsburgh Water committed to completing analysis of recent improvements and exploring grant funding options before holding a community meeting in Four Mile Run

Headline 2: Council holds public hearing on bill to reduce minimum lot sizes for residential development.
Summary 2: • Pittsburgh City Council held a public hearing on Bill 1579, which would reduce minimum lot size requirements across all residential zoning districts in the city

• **Current vs. proposed minimum lot sizes:**
  - Very low density: 8,000 to 6,000 square feet
  - Low density: 5,000 to 3,000 square feet  
  - Moderate density: 3,200 to 2,400 square feet
  - High density: 1,800 to 1,200 square feet
  - Very high density: 1,200 square feet to no minimum

• **The bill would eliminate minimum lot size per unit requirements** that currently restrict how many housing units can be built on a property

• City planning staff showed that **18% to over 50% of existing lots** in various residential districts don't meet current minimum size requirements, making many homes technically non-conforming

• **Supporters argued** the changes would make housing more affordable, allow rebuilding of homes that match neighborhood character, and reduce barriers for developers at the zoning board

• **Critics raised concerns** about increased density in already crowded areas, potential for gentrification, and preference for addressing short-term rentals instead

• The bill was originally part of a larger zoning package that included inclusionary zoning and parking reforms, but Council Member Wilson separated it for individual consideration

• **Many speakers urged Council to consider the full zoning package together** rather than piecemeal, arguing the reforms work better as a comprehensive approach

• The bill has support from Council Members Wilson (sponsor), Warwick, and Charland (co-sponsors)

Headline 3: Council schedules meeting on police, EMS and fire equipment after ambulance breaks down responding to emergency call.
Summary 3: • Council approved a special meeting focused on police, EMS, and fire department equipment after an ambulance broke down while responding to a cardiac arrest call

• The breakdown forced dispatchers to send a second ambulance to the emergency, highlighting serious equipment problems

• Councilman Coghill, who chairs public safety, requested the meeting and expressed concern about the overall condition of emergency vehicle fleets

• This follows a similar fleet review Coghill called for two years ago, but he says conditions haven't improved much due to lack of funding

• Council President Wilson supported the urgent meeting, calling ambulance breakdowns during emergencies "seriously wrong" and blaming lack of investment in basic equipment

• The meeting will focus only on life-saving departments (police, EMS, fire) and exclude other city departments like public works

• Council plans to schedule the meeting as soon as possible, potentially next week, given the emergency nature of the situation

• Leaders emphasized the need to properly equip emergency responders who risk their lives to help the public
