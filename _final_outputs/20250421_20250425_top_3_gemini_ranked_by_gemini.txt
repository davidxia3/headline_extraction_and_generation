Headline 1: Pittsburgh Water pauses four flood mitigation projects to prioritize funding for mandated system-wide repairs.
Summary 1: - Pittsburgh Water (PWSA) announced it is putting four major flood mitigation projects on hold to prioritize other critical repairs.
- The agency is shifting funds to a **$470 million**, court-ordered “Water Reliability Plan” to upgrade drinking water infrastructure. This is part of a larger, nearly **$1.2 billion** five-year capital plan that also prioritizes replacing lead service lines.
- The four projects being paused are:
    - Four Mile Run
    - Stewart Avenue
    - MLK Field
    - South Side Park
- The Four Mile Run project, which addresses severe sewage flooding, is now 90% designed but lacks the estimated **$30 million** needed for construction.
- PWSA has already spent **$8.7 million** on the Four Mile Run project's design and early phases.
- A key setback for the project was the loss of **$10 million** in funding from the Allegheny County Sanitary Authority (Alcosan). The funding was withdrawn after green infrastructure elements were removed from the plan due to technical issues, meaning the project no longer met Alcosan’s requirements.
- PWSA is now studying whether other recent sewer work in the Four Mile Run area has already helped reduce flooding.
- The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers stated that PWSA could apply for federal programs that may cover up to 75% of project costs.

Headline 2: City grants ALCOSAN underground land access for a major sewer project.
Summary 2: *   The Pittsburgh City Council voted unanimously to grant the Allegheny County Sanitary Authority (ALCOSAN) permanent underground access to nine city-owned properties.
*   In exchange for the access, ALCOSAN will pay the city a one-time fee of $8,200.
*   The access, known as an easement, will allow ALCOSAN to build tunnels about 150 feet below the surface.
*   These tunnels are part of a major, ongoing project to improve the regional sewer system and reduce overflows into the rivers.
*   The project is required by a 2008 Consent Decree between ALCOSAN and federal and state environmental agencies.
*   Council passed the resolution with a 9-0 vote, authorizing the mayor and other officials to finalize the agreement.

Headline 3: Legislation to increase paid sick days for workers advances to a public hearing.
Summary 3: - A proposal to increase the amount of paid sick time workers can earn in Pittsburgh is moving forward after a City Council vote.
- The ordinance, sponsored by Council President Lavelle, would make the following changes to the city’s Paid Sick Days Act:
    - For businesses with 15 or more employees, the maximum sick time an employee can accumulate would increase to 72 hours per year.
    - For businesses with fewer than 15 employees, the maximum would increase to 48 hours per year.
    - All employees would earn sick time at a rate of one hour for every 30 hours worked.
- Council members voted to schedule a public hearing to gather feedback on the proposed changes before taking a final vote.
- If the legislation is approved, the new rules would take effect on January 1, 2026.
